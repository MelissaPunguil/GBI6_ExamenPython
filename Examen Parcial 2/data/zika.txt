TI  - Next-generation sequencing for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance andpathogenicity in municipal wastewater treatment plants.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220802093415 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks antimicrobial resistance (AMR) andvarious pathogens among the top 10 health threats. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of human deaths due to AMR will reach 10 million annually. On theother hand, several infectious outbreaks such as SARS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola,Zika fever, and COVID-19 have severely affected human populations worldwide inthe last 20 years. These recent global diseases have generated the need tomonitor outbreaks of pathogens and AMR to establish effective public healthstrategies. This review presents AMR and pathogenicity associated with wastewatertreatment plants (WWTP), focusing on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) monitoring as a complementary system to clinical surveillance. In this regard, WWTP may bemonitored at three main points. First, at the inlet (raw wastewater or influent) to identify a broad spectrum of AMR and pathogens contained in the excretions of residents served by sewer networks, with a specific spatio-temporal location.Second, at the effluent, to ensure the elimination of AMR and pathogens in thetreated water, considering the rising demand for safe wastewater reuse. Third, insewage sludge or biosolids, since their beneficial use or final disposal canrepresent a significant risk to public health. This review is divided into twosections to address the importance and implications of AMR and pathogensurveillance in wastewater and WWTP, based on NGS. The first section presents thefundamentals of surveillance techniques applied in WWTP (metataxonomics,metagenomics, functional metagenomics, metaviromics, and metatranscriptomics).Their scope and limitations are analyzed to show how microbiological and qPCRtechniques complement NGS surveillance, overcoming its limitations. The secondsection discusses the contribution of 36 NGS research papers on WWTPsurveillance, highlighting the current situation and perspectives. In bothsections, research challenges and opportunities are presented.

PG  - e0010623
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010623 [doi]
AB  - Countermeasures against Zika virus (ZIKV), including vaccines, are frequentlytested in nonhuman primates (NHP). Macaque models are important for understandinghow ZIKV infections impact human pregnancy due to similarities in placentaldevelopment. The lack of consistent adverse pregnancy outcomes in ZIKV-affectedpregnancies poses a challenge in macaque studies where group sizes are oftensmall (4-8 animals). Studies in small animal models suggest that African-lineage Zika viruses can cause more frequent and severe fetal outcomes. No adverseoutcomes were observed in macaques exposed to 1x104 PFU (low dose) ofAfrican-lineage ZIKV at gestational day (GD) 45. Here, we exposed eight pregnant rhesus macaques to 1x108 PFU (high dose) of African-lineage ZIKV at GD 45 to testthe hypothesis that adverse pregnancy outcomes are dose-dependent. Three of eightpregnancies ended prematurely with fetal death. ZIKV was detected in both fetaland placental tissues from all cases of early fetal loss. Further refinements of this exposure system (e.g., varying the dose and timing of infection) could lead to an even more consistent, unambiguous fetal loss phenotype for assessing ZIKVcountermeasures in pregnancy. These data demonstrate that high-dose exposure toAfrican-lineage ZIKV causes pregnancy loss in macaques and also suggest thatZIKV-induced first trimester pregnancy loss could be strain-specific.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes congenital defects. Sexual transmission of ZIKV was confirmed in a recent epidemic; however,mechanisms behind ZIKV infection and persistence in the male reproductive tractare unknown. Previously, we found that approximately 33% of men with symptomatic ZIKV infections shed ZIKV RNA in semen, and some men shed ZIKV RNA for >3 months.Here, we evaluated the semen of 49 ZIKV-infected men to identify immune factorscorrelating with long-term ZIKV shedding in semen and ZIKV-infected cell types insemen. We found prolonged ZIKV RNA shedding in semen was associated with malereproductive tract inflammation, indicated by higher leukocyte counts andinflammatory cytokine concentrations in semen of long-term versus short-termshedders. Additionally, we found ZIKV RNA in seminal leukocytes and epithelialcells. This study of human semen from ZIKV-infected men provides criticalinsights into impacts of ZIKV on male reproductive tract health.

PG  - 131-133
LID - 10.1016/j.ijregi.2022.07.006 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Health Department retrospectively reportedsix cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) from a cohort of febrile patients during outbreaksof dengue and malaria in 2016. However, the transmission of ZIKV remains unclear due to lack of testing capability. This study aimed to determine the level ofimmunity to ZIKV among PNG military personnel (PNGMP) in 2019. Methods: Sera of208 PNGMP recruited in April 2019 was tested for the presence of anti-ZIKVimmunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) antibodies using Euroimmun IgG/IgM detectionkits, and anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibody (Nab) against a ZIKV African strain on all anti-ZIKV-IgG/IgM(+) samples. Results: Anti-ZIKV seropositivity of these serawas as follows: IgG, 67%; IgM, 9%; and Nab, 65%. Five of 19 anti-ZIKV-IgM(+)samples had anti-ZIKV-Nab titres >/=20, as well as an anti-ZIKV-Nab titre ratio>/=4 compared with the Nab titres of four anti-dengue serotypes, so met thecriteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmed ZIKV infection.Conclusions: The prevalence of anti-ZIKV-Nab of 65% suggests that there are high levels of ZIKV exposure among PNGMP. Five of the 19 anti-ZIKV-IgM(+) samples met the WHO criteria for confirmed ZIKV infection, suggesting a recent undetectedoutbreak in PNGMP. These results provide better understanding of the current ZIKVepidemic status in PNGMP.

LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2022.07.030 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that infectshumans and can cause birth defects and neurological disorders. Its non-structuralprotein 3 (NS3) contains a protease domain and a helicase domain, both of whichplay essential roles during the viral life cycle. However, it has been shown thatZIKV NS3 has an inherently weak helicase activity, making it unable to unwindlong RNA duplexes alone. How this activity is stimulated to process the viralgenome and whether the two domains of NS3 are functionally coupled remainunclear. Here we used optical tweezers to characterize the RNA unwindingproperties of ZIKV NS3-including its processivity, velocity, and step size-at thesingle-molecule level. We found that external forces that weaken the stability ofthe duplex RNA substrate significantly enhance the helicase activity of ZIKV NS3.On the other hand, we showed that the protease domain increases the bindingaffinity of NS3 to RNA but has only a minor effect on unwinding per se. Ourfindings suggest that the ZIKV NS3 helicase is activated on demand in the contextof viral replication, a paradigm that may be generalizable to other flaviviruses.

AB  - Mosquitoes are a vector of human disease transmitting malaria, and manyarboviruses such as dengue virus and Zika virus. This study determined mosquitolarval occurrence and abundance in residential areas around Suratthani RajabhatUniversity as influenced by ecological factors and breeding container diversity. Mosquito larvae were collected using a standard dipping method from 95 locations during April through September 2019 and environmental factors such asphysicochemical parameters of water in the breeding containers were measured.During the survey, a total of 194 houses were inspected, of which 58 were foundto be infested with mosquito larvae, with a house index of 29.90, a containerindex of 25.55, and a Breteau index of 48.99. A total of 5,123 mosquito larvaewere reported from seven breeding habitat types namely, plastics, cement, mudpots, glass, foam, discarded tires and natural materials. Among the collectedlarvae, Aedes albopictus (56.45%) was most prevalent, while Culex sp. (22.33%)and Aedes aegypti were less prevalent (21.21%). The most common mosquito larvaebreeding habitats were plastics (44.22%) followed by discarded tires (18.14%).The spearman correlation analysis showed that the number of mosquito larvae were significantly positively correlated with the depths and width of containers(p<0.05). These findings are helpful in understanding the ecological factors and breeding habitat types that influence mosquito species and their abundance, andalso in determining ways to control mosquito borne diseases.

TI  - Inhibition of dengue virus infection by trifluoperazine.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05555-y [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, isthe most widespread viral pathogen transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Despitethe increased incidence of DENV infection, there are no antiviral drugs availablefor treatment or prevention. Phenothiazines are heterocyclic compounds withvarious pharmacological properties that are very adaptable for drug repurposing. In the present report, we analyzed the antiviral activity against DENV and therelated Zika virus (ZIKV) of trifluoperazine (TFP), a phenothiazine derivative inclinical use as an antipsychotic and antiemetic agent. TFP exhibiteddose-dependent inhibitory activity against the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV inmonkey Vero cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations with 50% effectiveconcentration values in the range 1.6-6.4 microM. A similar level of antiviralefficacy was exhibited by TFP against flavivirus infection in the human celllines A549 and HepG2. Mechanistic studies, performed using time-dependentinfectivity assays, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescencetechniques, indicated that uncoating of the virus during penetration into thecell was the main target for TFP in infected cells, but the compound also exerteda minor effect on a late stage of the virus multiplication cycle. This studydemonstrates that TFP, a pharmacologically active phenothiazine, is a selectiveinhibitor of DENV multiplication in cell culture. Our findings open perspectives for the repositioning of phenothiazines like TFP with a wide spectrum ofantiviral efficacy as potential agents for the control of pathogenicflaviviruses.

AB  - First identified in 1947, Zika virus took roughly 70 years to cause a pandemicunusually associated with virus-induced brain damage in newborns. Zika virus istransmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, and secondarily, Aedesalbopictus, both colonizing a large strip encompassing tropical and temperateregions. As part of the international project ZIKAlliance initiated in 2016, 50mosquito populations from six species collected in 12 countries wereexperimentally infected with different Zika viruses. Here, we show that Ae.aegypti is mainly responsible for Zika virus transmission having the highestsusceptibility to viral infections. Other species play a secondary role intransmission while Culex mosquitoes are largely non-susceptible. Zika strain isexpected to significantly modulate transmission efficiency with African strainsbeing more likely to cause an outbreak. As the distribution of Ae. aegypti willdoubtless expand with climate change and without new marketed vaccines, all theingredients are in place to relive a new pandemic of Zika.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE IN AEDES AEGYPTI FROM THE ZOOLOGICALGARDEN OF HAVANA, CUBA.
LID - 10.2987/22-7068 [doi]
AB  - Chemical control of Aedes aegypti continues to be an indispensable alternative topreventing dengue, Zika, and chikungunya outbreaks. The Havana Zoological Garden requires constant vigilance because its special characteristics help in thespread of the causal agents of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, which put the health of visitors at risk. The goals of this study were to determine the levelof susceptibility and insecticide resistance mechanisms in the Ae. aegyptipopulation. Temephos susceptibility in larvae was evaluated with bioassays using the World Health Organization's methodology, and susceptibility of adultmosquitoes was determined by the impregnated bottle bioassay, recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Resistance mechanisms were determinedwith biochemical assays. Mosquito larvae from the Havana Zoo were found resistantto temephos, which was associated with the activity of the enzymes alpha- andbeta-esterases and mixed function oxidases but not glutathione-S-transferase.Adult mosquitoes were susceptible to pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin,deltamethrin, and cypermethrin), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos), and carbamate(bendiocarb). Temephos resistance detected in the mosquito population from theHavana Zoo is an alert for the Vector Control Program, which must take measuresto manage their resistance, relying on the surveillance carried out by Cuba'smedical entomology laboratories.

TI  - Oral alterations in children with microcephaly associated to congenital Zikasyndrome: A systematic review and meta-analyses.
LID - 10.1111/scd.12761 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To synthesize the oral alterations observed in children with microcephalyassociated with congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS); and to compare the oralalterations of these children to a normotypic healthy controls. METHODS ANDRESULTS: A search was performed in six electronic databases. Observationalstudies published that reported oral alterations in children with CZS wereselected. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed study quality, usingthe Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools, and the certaintyof evidence, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development andEvaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled crude occurrence showed 88% of increasedsalivation (95%CI: 82%-94%), 83% of biofilm (95%CI: 75%-91%), and 73% of bruxism (95%CI: 52%-95%). Compared to normotypic controls, children with CZS-associatedmicrocephaly had a higher chance to have difficulty in lip sealing (OR: 18.28;95%CI: 1.42-235.91), inadequate lingual posture at rest (OR: 13.57; 95%CI:4.24-43.44), and delayed eruption (OR: 12.92; 95%CI: 3.42-48.78), with very lowcertainty. CONCLUSION: There are several oral alterations found among childrenwith CZS-associated microcephaly. They are more prone to present some of thesealterations, such as difficulty in lip sealing, although with very low certainty of evidence.

AB  - Optimized methods for the detection of flavivirus infections in hyperendemicareas are still needed, especially for working with patient serum as a startingmaterial. The focus-forming assay (FFA) reveals critical aspects of virus-hostinteractions, as it is a quantitative assay to determine viral loads. Automatedimage analysis provides evaluations of relative amounts of intracellular viralprotein at the single-cell level. Here, we developed an optimized FFA for thedetection of infectious Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) viral particlesin cell cultures and clinical serum samples, respectively. Vero-76 cells wereinfected with DENV-2 (16681) or ZIKV (PRVA BC59). Using a panel of anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the primary mAbs,concentration, and the optimal time of infection were determined. To determinewhether intracellular accumulation of NS1 improved the efficiency of the FFA,brefeldin A was added to the cultures. Focus formation was identified byconventional optical microscopy combined with CellProfiler automated imageanalysis software. The FFA was used with spike assays for ZIKV and clinicalspecimens from natural infection by DENV-1 and DENV-2. mAb 7744-644 for ZIKV and mAb 724-323 for DENV used at a concentration of 1 mug/ml and a time of 24 hourspostinfection produced the best detection of foci when combining conventionalcounting and automated digital analysis. Brefeldin A did not improve theassessment of FFUs or their digitally assessed intensity at single-cell level.The FFA showed 95% ZIKV recovery and achieved the detection of circulating DENV-1and DENV-2 in the plasma of acutely ill patients. The combination of the twotechniques optimized the FFA, allowing the study of DENV and ZIKV in culturesupernatants and clinical specimens from natural infection in hyperendemic areas.

AB  - The global distribution of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is the subjectof considerable attention because of its pivotal role as a biological vector ofseveral high profile disease pathogens including dengue, chikungunya, yellowfever, and Zika viruses. There is also a lot of interest in the projected future species' distribution. However, less effort has been focused on its historicaldistribution, which has changed substantially over the past 100years, especially in southern Europe where it was once widespread, but largely disappeared by themiddle of the 20th century. The present work utilises all available historicalrecords of the distribution of Ae. aegypti in southern Europe, the Near Eastwithin the Mediterranean Basin and North Africa from the late 19th century until the 1960's to construct a spatial distribution model using matching historicalclimatic and demographic data. The resulting model was then implemented usingcurrent climate and demographic data to assess the potential distribution of the vector in the present. The models were rerun with several different assumptionsabout the thresholds that determine habitat suitability for Ae. aegypti. Thehistorical model matches the historical distributions well. When it is run withcurrent climate values, the predicted present day distribution is somewhatbroader than it used to be particularly in north-west France, North Africa andTurkey. Though it is beginning to reappear in the eastern Caucasus, this'potential' distribution clearly does not match the actual distribution of thespecies, which suggests some other factors are responsible for its absence.Future distributions based on the historical model also do not match futuredistributions derived from models based only on present day vector distributions,which predict little or no presence in the Mediterranean Region. At the sametime, the vector is widespread in the USA which is predicted to consolidate itsrange there in future. This contradiction and the implication for possiblere-invasion of Europe are discussed.

TI  - Prevalence of individual brain and eye defects potentially related to Zika virus in pregnancy in 22 U.S. states and territories, January 2016 to June 2017.
LID - 10.1002/bdr2.2067 [doi]
AB  - During the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Zika Virus Response,birth defects surveillance programs adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomesoccurring during January 2016 to June 2017 in 22 U.S. states and territories wereused to estimate the prevalence of those brain and eye defects potentiallyrelated to ZIKV. Jurisdictions were divided into three groups: areas withwidespread ZIKV transmission, areas with limited local ZIKV transmission, andareas without local ZIKV transmission. Prevalence estimates for selected brainand eye defects and microcephaly per 10,000 live births were estimated.Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated usingPoisson regression for areas with widespread and limited ZIKV transmissioncompared with areas without local ZIKV transmission. Defects with significantlyhigher prevalence in areas of widespread transmission were pooled, and PRs werecalculated by quarter, comparing subsequent quarters to the first quarter(January-March 2016). Nine defects had significantly higher prevalence in areasof widespread transmission. The highest PRs were seen in intracranialcalcifications (PR = 12.6, 95% CI [7.4, 21.3]), chorioretinal abnormalities (12.5[7.1, 22.3]), brainstem abnormalities (9.3 [4.7, 18.4]), and cerebral/corticalatrophy (6.7 [4.2, 10.8]). The PR of the nine pooled defects was significantlyhigher in three quarters in areas with widespread transmission. The largestdifference in prevalence was observed for defects consistently reported ininfants with congenital ZIKV infection. Birth defects surveillance programs couldconsider monitoring a subset of birth defects potentially related to ZIKV inpregnancy.

TI  - Effect of neurodevelopmental treatment in children with congenital Zika syndrome:A pilot study.
LID - 10.1111/jpc.16139 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) in childrenwith congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). METHODS: This prospective, interventionalcohort study involved children with CZS undergoing follow-up at a specialistcentre in northeastern Brazil. The duration of the proposed NDT protocol was 1year, with 45-min sessions delivered one to five times weekly. Motor function,weight, height, head circumference and the incidence of comorbidities wereevaluated in children before protocol initiation and then at 3, 6 and 12 monthsof treatment. RESULTS: Thirty children were evaluated (age mean 30.1 +/- 3months). Motor function improved from baseline to 6 months (P = 0.001). Nodifference in weight and head circumference z-score (P = 0.51 and P = 0.29,respectively), but an increase in height z-score (P < 0.001) was observed overthe evaluation period. There was a reduction in the incidence of upperrespiratory tract infections, pneumonia and urinary tract infections over thefollow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: NDT proved to be a viable treatment approach that can improve motor function and reduce the incidence of comorbidities in children with CZS, while having no harmful effects on their growth.

TI  - Japanese encephalitis virus persists in the human reproductive epithelium andporcine reproductive tissues.
PG  - e0010656
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010656 [doi]
AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the emerging and geographically expandingflavivirus and the major causative agent of encephalitis in humans in Asia. Thereare risks of JEV introduction into the Americas given a large population ofamplifying hosts-pigs and wild boars, and insect vectors-Culex mosquitoes. There are emerging concerns about vector-free ways of flavivirus transmission, forexample sexual and transplacental Zika virus transmissions, which may changeflavivirus epidemiology and expand the geographical range to territories with no insect vectors. It is unknown whether JEV has tropism in the female lowerreproductive tract and the potential for sexual transmission in humans. Whileclinical outcomes of transplacental JEV infection are described in humans andpigs, cellular targets and tissue tropism in the upper reproductive tract arealso unknown. Here, we studied JEV infection phenotypes and host transcriptional responses in human reproductive epithelial cells. We found that JEV causedpersistent infection and cytopathology in the vaginal epithelium, endometrialepithelium, and trophoblast. Human vaginal epithelial cells infected with JEV hadaltered transcriptional responses associated with inflammation and disruption of epithelial barrier function. Also, using pigs-the native amplifying host for JEV,we confirmed JEV tropism in the female lower and upper reproductive tracts. Wediscovered that JEV persists in the vaginal mucosa for at least 28 days and pigs shed the virus in vaginal secretions. We also found JEV persistence in theendometrium and placenta with transplacental and fetal infections. Altogether, wediscovered that JEV targets the vaginal epithelium and has the potential forsexual transmission in humans. We also contributed to a better understanding ofJEV pathogenesis during transplacental infection. Further studies are needed tobetter understand the interactions of JEV with reproductive tissues, howpersistent infection affects female reproductive functions, and the risks fornon-vector transmission.

TI  - FACT subunit SUPT16H associates with BRD4 and contributes to silencing ofinterferon signaling.
LID - gkac645 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac645 [doi]
AB  - FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription) is a heterodimeric protein complexcomposed of SUPT16H and SSRP1, and a histone chaperone participating in chromatinremodeling during gene transcription. FACT complex is profoundly regulated, andcontributes to both gene activation and suppression. Here we reported thatSUPT16H, a subunit of FACT, is acetylated in both epithelial and natural killer(NK) cells. The histone acetyltransferase TIP60 contributes to the acetylation ofSUPT16H middle domain (MD) at lysine 674 (K674). Such acetylation of SUPT16H isrecognized by bromodomain protein BRD4, which promotes protein stability ofSUPT16H in both epithelial and NK cells. We further demonstrated thatSUPT16H-BRD4 associates with histone modification enzymes (HDAC1, EZH2), andfurther regulates their activation status and/or promoter association as well as affects the relevant histone marks (H3ac, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3). BRD4 is known toprofoundly regulate interferon (IFN) signaling, while such function of SUPT16Hhas never been explored. Surprisingly, our results revealed that SUPT16H genetic knockdown via RNAi or pharmacological inhibition by using its inhibitor, curaxin 137 (CBL0137), results in the induction of IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes(ISGs). Through this mechanism, depletion or inhibition of SUPT16H is shown toefficiently inhibit infection of multiple viruses, including Zika, influenza, andSARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that depletion or inhibition of SUPT16H also causes the remarkable activation of IFN signaling in NK cells, whichpromotes the NK-mediated killing of virus-infected cells in a co-culture systemusing human primary NK cells. Overall, our studies unraveled the previouslyun-appreciated role of FACT complex in coordinating with BRD4 and regulating IFN signaling in both epithelial and NK cells, and also proposed the novelapplication of the FACT inhibitor CBL0137 to treat viral infections.

TI  - Efficient Gene Transfer to Kidney Using a Lentiviral Vector Pseudotyped with ZikaVirus Envelope Glycoprotein.
LID - 10.1089/hum.2022.053 [doi]
AB  - Gene therapy's entrance into clinical settings has made it an ever moreattractive field of study for various diseases. However, relatively littleprogress has been made in targeting kidney diseases due to poor gene deliveryefficiency in renal cells. The development of novel gene therapy vectors formedical intervention to treat kidney diseases is needed. In this study, wedesigned and produced a pseudotyped lentiviral vector with envelope glycoproteinsof Zika virus, and evaluated its potential use in viral vector entry,neutralization assay and gene delivery especially in the renal context. Thelentiviral vector, simplified as ZIKV-E, is pseudotyped with Env/G-TCrepresenting the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CY) domains of Env replaced with the TM and CY domains of the glycoprotein (G) of the vesicular stomatitisvirus. In vivo results shows that ZIKV-E induced efficient transduction intubular epithelial cells in mouse kidneys, demonstrating more than 100-foldhigher expression of exogenous GFP gene compared to that achieved by Vesicularstomatitis virus G protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector (VSV-G). The resultsalso showed that the vector ZIKV-E transduced cells in a pH-independent mannerand the transduction was inhibited by anti-ZIKV Env domain III antibodies.Results also show that ZIKV-E can be used as a surrogate for studies of ZIKVentry mechanisms and neutralization antibody assay. In all, this studysuccessfully demonstrated a novel pseudotyped lentiviral vector ZIKV-E forinducing high transduction efficiency in renal tubular epithelial cells whichcould serve as a foundation for gene therapy for the treatment of inherited renaldiseases in humans.

TI  - The envelope protein of Zika virus interacts with apolipoprotein E early in theinfectious cycle and this interaction is conserved on the secreted viralparticles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has causedmassive outbreaks of infection in tropical areas over the last decade and has nowbegun spreading to temperate countries. Little is currently known about thespecific host factors involved in the intracellular life cycle of ZIKV.Flaviviridae viruses interact closely with host-cell lipid metabolism andassociated secretory pathways. Another Flaviviridae, hepatitis C virus, is highlydependent on apolipoprotein E (ApoE) for the completion of its infectious cycle. We therefore investigated whether ZIKV also interacted with this protein.METHODS: ZIKV infections were performed on both liver and microglia derived cell lines in order to proceed to colocalization analysis and immunoprecipitationassays of ApoE and Zika envelope glycoprotein (Zika E). Transmission electronmicroscopy combined to immunogold labeling was also performed on the infectedcells and related supernatant to study the association of ApoE and Zika E proteinin the virus-induced membrane rearrangements and secreted particles,respectively. Finally, the potential of neutralization of anti-ApoE antibodies onZIKV particles was studied. RESULT: We demonstrated an interaction between ApoEand the Zika E protein. This specific interaction was observed in virus-inducedhost-cell membrane rearrangements, but also on newly formed intracellularparticles. The partial neutralizing effect of anti-ApoE antibody and theimmunogold labeling of the two proteins on secreted virions indicates that thisinteraction is conserved during ZIKV intracellular trafficking and release.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that another member of the Flaviviridae alsointeracts with ApoE, indicating that this could be a common mechanism for theviruses from this family.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead to severe neurological disorders and fetaldefects, which has become a public health problem worldwide. However, effectiveclinical treatment for ZIKV infection was still arduous. Antihistamines areattractive candidates for drug repurposing due to their low price and widespread availability. Here we screened FDA-approved antihistamine drugs to obtainanti-ZIKV candidate compounds and identified mebhydrolin napadisylate (MHL) that exhibits the potent inhibition of ZIKV infection in various cell lines in ahistamine H1 receptor-independent manner. Mechanistic studies suggest that MHLacts as a ZIKV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, supported by a structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis showing the correlation betweenthe inhibitory effect upon viral RNA synthesis and ZIKV infectivity. Furthermore,MHL was shown to bind ZIKV NS5 RdRp in vitro and predicted to interact with keyresidues at the active site of ZIKV NS5 RdRp by molecular docking analysis. Ourdata together suggest that MHL suppresses ZIKV infection through the inhibitionof ZIKV NS5 RdRp activity. This study highlights that MHL might be a promisingclinical anti-ZIKV therapeutic.

AB  - Adults contracting Zika virus (ZIKV) typically exhibit mild symptoms, yet ZIKVinfection of pregnant individuals can cause miscarriage or birth defects in theiroffspring. Many studies have focused on maternal-to-fetal ZIKV transmission viablood and placenta. Notably, however, ZIKV is also transmitted sexually, raising the possibility that ZIKV could infect the embryo shortly after fertilization,long before the placenta is established. Here, we evaluate the consequences ofZIKV infection in mouse embryos during the first few days of embryogenesis. Weshow that divergent strains of ZIKV can infect the fetal lineage and can causedevelopmental arrest, raising concern for the developmental consequences ofsexual ZIKV transmission. This article has an associated 'The people behind thepapers' interview.

TI  - DEAD-Box Helicase DDX3X as a Host Target against Emerging Viruses: New Insightsfor Medicinal Chemical Approaches.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00755 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, globalization, global warming, and population aging havecontributed to the spread of emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses (COVs), WestNile (WNV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV). The number of reported infections is increasing, and considering the high viral mutation rate, it is conceivable that it will increase significantly in the coming years. The risk caused by viruses isnow more evident due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need to findnew broad-spectrum antiviral agents able to tackle the present pandemic andfuture epidemics. DDX3X helicase is a host factor required for viral replication.Selective inhibitors have been identified and developed into broad-spectrumantivirals active against emerging pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and mostimportantly against drug-resistant strains. This perspective describes theinhibitors identified in the last years, highlighting their therapeutic potentialas innovative broad-spectrum antivirals.

TI  - Identification of Potential Insect Growth Inhibitor against Aedes aegypti: ABioinformatics Approach.
LID - 8218 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158218 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector that transmits viral diseases such as dengue,hemorrhagic dengue, urban yellow fever, zika, and chikungunya. Worldwide, manycases of dengue have been reported in recent years, showing significant growth.The best way to manage diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti is to control thevector with insecticides, which have already been shown to be toxic to humans;moreover, insects have developed resistance. Thus, the development of newinsecticides is considered an emergency. One way to achieve this goal is to applycomputational methods based on ligands and target information. In this study,sixteen compounds with acceptable insecticidal activities, with 100% larvicidalactivity at low concentrations (2.0 to 0.001 mg.L(-1)), were selected from theliterature. These compounds were used to build up and validate pharmacophoremodels. Pharmacophore model 6 (AUC = 0.78; BEDROC = 0.6) was used to filter 4793 compounds from the subset of lead-like compounds from the ZINC database; 4142compounds (dG &lt; 0 kcal/mol) were then aligned to the active site of thejuvenile hormone receptor Aedes aegypti (PDB: 5V13), 2240 compounds (LE &lt;-0.40 kcal/mol) were prioritized for molecular docking from the construction of achitin deacetylase model of Aedes aegypti by the homology modeling of the Bombyx mori species (PDB: 5ZNT), which aligned 1959 compounds (dG &lt; 0 kcal/mol), and 20 compounds (LE &lt; -0.4 kcal/mol) were predicted for pharmacokinetic andtoxicological prediction in silico (Preadmet, SwissADMET, and eMolTox programs). Finally, the theoretical routes of compounds M01, M02, M03, M04, and M05 wereproposed. Compounds M01-M05 were selected, showing significant differences inpharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters in relation to positive controls andinteraction with catalytic residues among key protein sites reported in theliterature. For this reason, the molecules investigated here are dual inhibitors of the enzymes chitin synthase and juvenile hormonal protein from insects andhumans, characterizing them as potential insecticides against the Aedes aegyptimosquito.

TI  - Big Data to Knowledge Analytics Reveals the Zika Virus Epidemic as Only One ofMultiple Factors Contributing to a Year-Over-Year 28-Fold Increase inMicrocephaly Incidence.
LID - 9051 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159051 [doi]
AB  - During the 2015-2016 Zika Virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil, the geographicaldistributions of ZIKV infection and microcephaly outbreaks did not align. Thisraised doubts about the virus as the single cause of the microcephaly outbreakand led to research hypotheses of alternative explanatory factors, such asenvironmental variables and factors, agrochemical use, or immunizations. Weinvestigated context and the intermediate and structural determinants of healthinequalities, as well as social environment factors, to determine theirinteraction with ZIKV-positive- and ZIKV-negative-related microcephaly. Theresults revealed the identification of 382 associations among 382 nonredundantvariables of Zika surveillance, including multiple determinants of environmental public health factors and variables obtained from 5565 municipalities in Brazil. This study compared those factors and variables directly associated withmicrocephaly incidence positive to ZIKV and those associated with microcephalyincidence negative to ZIKV, respectively, and mapped them in case and controlsubnetworks. The subnetworks of factors and variables associated with low birthweight and birthweight where birth incidence served as an additional control werealso mapped. Non-significant differences in factors and variables were observed, as were weights of associations between microcephaly incidence, both positive andnegative to ZIKV, which revealed diagnostic inaccuracies that translated to theunderestimation of the scope of the ZIKV outbreak. A detailed analysis of thepatterns of association does not support a finding that vaccinations contributed to microcephaly, but it does raise concerns about the use of agrochemicals as apotential factor in the observed neurotoxicity arising from the presence of heavymetals in the environment and microcephaly not associated with ZIKV. Summary: Acomparative network inferential analysis of the patterns of variables and factorsassociated with Zika virus infections in Brazil during 2015-2016 coinciding with a microcephaly epidemic identified multiple contributing determinants. This studyadvances our understanding of the cumulative interactive effects of exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors in the built, natural, physical, and socialenvironments on adverse pregnancy and health outcomes in vulnerable populations.

PG  - e0010602
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010602 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to their direct pathogenic effects, arthropod-borne(arboviruses) have been hypothesized to indirectly contribute to hospitalizationsand death through decompensation of pre-existing comorbidities. Using nationwide data routinely collected from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019 in Brazil, weinvestigated whether local increases in arbovirus notifications were associatedwith excess hospitalization. METHODS: We estimated the relative risks for theassociation between municipality- and state-level increases in arboviral casenotifications and age-standardized hospitalization rates (i.e., classified asdirect or indirect based on ICD-10 codes) using Bayesian multilevel models withrandom effects accounting for temporal and geographic correlations. Formunicipality-level analyses, we excluded municipalities with <200 notificationsof a given arbovirus and further adjusted the models for the local Gini Index,Human Development Index, and Family Healthcare Strategy (Estrategia de Saude daFamilia) coverage. Models for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya were performedseparately. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2019, Brazil registered 7,566,330 confirmeddengue cases, 159,029 confirmed ZIKV cases, and 433,887 confirmed CHIKV cases.Dengue notifications have an endemic and seasonal pattern, with cases present in 5334 of the 5570 (95.8%) Brazilian municipalities and most (69.5%) registeredbetween February and May. Chikungunya notifications followed a similar seasonalpattern to DENV but with a smaller incidence and were restricted to 4390 (78.8%) municipalities. ZIKV was only notified in 2581 (46.3%) municipalities. Increases in dengue and chikungunya notifications were associated with small increases inage-standardized arbovirus-related hospitalizations, but no consistentassociation was found with all-cause or other specific indirect causes ofhospitalization. Zika was associated to increases in hospitalizations byneurological diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no clear associationbetween increased incidence of the three arboviruses and excess risks ofall-cause or indirect hospitalizations at the municipality- and state-levels,follow-up investigations at the individual-level are warranted to define anypotential role of acute arbovirus infection in exacerbating risks ofhospitalization from underlying conditions.

Advancements innext-generation sequencing and metagenomics have expanded our knowledge on therichness of RNA viruses harbored by arthropods such as Ae. aegypti and Ae.albopictus. Increasing evidence suggests that vector competence can be modifiedby the microbiome (comprising both bacteriome and virome) of mosquitoes presentin endemic zones. Using an RNA-seq-based metataxonomic approach, this studydetermined the virome structure, Wolbachia presence and mitochondrial diversityof field-caught Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in Medellin, Colombia, a municipality with a high incidence of mosquito-transmitted arboviruses. The twospecies are sympatric, but their core viromes differed considerably in richness, diversity, and abundance; although the community of viral species identified was large and complex, the viromes were dominated by few virus species. BLASTsearches of assembled contigs suggested that at least 17 virus species (16 ofwhich are insect-specific viruses [ISVs]) infect the Ae. aegypti population.Dengue virus 3 was detected in one sample and it was the only pathogenic virusdetected. In Ae. albopictus, up to 11 ISVs and one plant virus were detected.Therefore, the virome composition appears to be species-specific. The bacterialendosymbiont Wolbachia was identified in all Ae. albopictus samples and in someAe. aegypti samples collected after 2017. The presence of Wolbachia sp. in Ae.aegypti was not related to significant changes in the richness, diversity, orabundance of this mosquito's virome, although it was related to an increase inthe abundance of Aedes aegypti To virus 2 (Metaviridae). The mitochondrialdiversity of these mosquitoes suggested that the Ae. aegypti population underwenta change that started in the second half of 2017, which coincides with therelease of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Medellin, indicating that thepopulation of wMel-infected mosquitoes released has introduced new alleles intothe wild Ae. aegypti population of Medellin. However, additional studies arerequired on the dispersal speed and intergenerational stability of wMel inMedellin and nearby areas as well as on the introgression of genetic variants in the native mosquito population.

AB  - Over the past decade, the Pacific region has experienced many arboviraloutbreaks, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Papua New Guinea(PNG) has a high burden of arboviral diseases, but there is a paucity ofknowledge about the epidemiology and circulation of these viruses in the country.In this study, we report investigations into suspected arboviral outbreaks offebrile disease in PNG from December 2015 to June 2017. DENV-1 and DENV-2 werethe mostly commonly detected viruses, and low circulation of DENV-3 and ZIKV was also detected. DENV-4 and CHIKV were not detected during this period. Full genomesequencing of selected positive samples revealed that circulation was dominatedby endemic indigenous strains belonging to DENV-1 (genotype IV) and DENV-2(genotype C) that have been present in the country for up to a decade. A DENV-2sublineage was also identified that has been associated with outbreaks of severe dengue in both PNG and the Solomon Islands.

LID - tpmd211087 [pii]
AB  - Standard molecular detection of many pathogens, in particular RNA viruses,requires appropriate handling in the field for preserving the quality of thesample until processing. This could be challenging in remote tropical areas.Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are RNAviruses, prominent among the causes of fever in the tropics. We aimed to test thestability of arboviral RNA in contrived dried blood spots prepared on Whatman 903Protein saver cards as a means of sample collection and storage. We were able to detect DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV by real-time RT-PCR up to 180 days after cardinoculation with stable Ct values across the study period. Our study supportsdried blood spots (DBS) on protein saver cards as a platform for stable detectionof arboviral RNA of sufficient quality to be used in diagnostic RT-PCR assays andnext generation sequencing.

AB  - It is currently not clear whether humoral immunity to Zika virus (ZIKV) elicited upon natural ZIKV infection is long-lasting. In addition, cross-reactivity ofanti-ZIKV antibodies with antigenically related dengue viruses (DENV) may havebiological implications in nonnaive individuals who subsequently acquire aheterotypic infection. Cross-reactive humoral immunity between ZIKV and DENV alsocomplicates the interpretation of serological tests to evaluate previous exposureto either virus. Here, we have measured the 2-year decay of ZIKV neutralizingantibodies in people living in a ZIKV/DENV endemic area in Brazil who wereidentified as having an acute infection (group 1) or past (but recent) infection (group 2) with ZIKV in 2015-16. The titers of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKVdecreased 9.1 and 2.3 times in groups 1 and 2, respectively. We also show thatthe plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT) is a reliable method to measure past exposure to ZIKV in coendemic areas.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Zika Virus among Forest Fringe Communities in PeninsularMalaysia and Sabah: General Population-Based Study.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0988 [doi]
LID - tpmd210988 [pii]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has had a history in Malaysia since its first isolation in1966. However, it is believed that the immunity status among forest fringecommunities has been underreported. We conducted cross-sectional surveillance of forest fringe communities from 10 Orang Asli villages and their peripheralcommunities in Perak, Pahang, and Sabah in Malaysia. A total of 706 samples were collected from 2019 to 2020 and screened for ZIKV exposure using an anti-ZIKV IgGELISA kit. A neutralization assay against ZIKV was used to confirm the reactivesamples. The seroprevalence results reported from the study of this population inMalaysia were 21.0% (n = 148, 95% CI, 0.183-0.273) after confirmation with a focireduction neutralization test. The presence of neutralizing antibodies providesevidence that the studied forest fringe communities in Malaysia have been exposedto ZIKV. Multivariate analysis showed that those older than 44 years and thosewith an education below the university level had been exposed significantly toZIKV. In addition, higher seropositivity rates to ZIKV were also reported amongsecondary school students from Bentong (Pahang) and residents from Segaliud(Sabah). No associations were identified between Zika seropositivity and gender, household size, house radius to the jungle, and income level. The presence ofneutralizing antibodies against ZIKV among the study population might indicatethat the causative pathogen had already circulated widely in forest fringeregions. Intervention for vector control, protection from mosquito bites, andawareness improvement should be encouraged in this population.

TI  - Wolbachia wPip Blocks Zika Virus Transovarial Transmission in Aedes albopictus.
PG  - e0263321
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02633-21 [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia is being developed as a biological tool to suppress mosquitopopulations and/or interfere with their transmitted viruses. Adult males with an artificial Wolbachia infection have been released, successfully yieldingpopulation suppression in multiple field trials. The main characteristic of theartificial Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes used in the suppression program is thelower vector competence than that in native infected/uninfected mosquitoes inhorizontal and vertical transmission. Our previous studies have demonstrated thatthe Aedes albopictus HC line infected with a trio of Wolbachia strains exhibited almost complete blockade of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) inhorizontal and vertical transmission. However, the extent to which Wolbachiainhibits virus transovarial transmission is unknown since no studies have beenperformed to determine whether Wolbachia protects ovarian cells against viralinfection. Here, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae. albopictus GUA (a wild-typemosquito line superinfected with two native Wolbachia strains, wAlbA and wAlbB), HC, and GT lines (tetracycline-cured, Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes), whichexhibit key traits, and compared them to better understand how Wolbachia inhibitsZIKV transovarial transmission. Our results showed that the infection rate ofadult GT progeny was significantly higher than that of GUA progeny during thefirst and second gonotrophic cycles. In contrast, the infection rates of adult GTand GUA progeny were not significantly different during the third gonotrophiccycle. All examined adult HC progeny from three gonotrophic cycles were negative for ZIKV infection. A strong negative linear correlation existed betweenWolbachia density and ZIKV load in the ovaries of mosquitoes. Although there isno obvious coexistence area in the ovaries for Wolbachia and ZIKV, host immuneresponses may play a role in Wolbachia blocking ZIKV expansion and maintenance inthe ovaries of Ae. albopictus. These results will aid in understandingWolbachia-ZIKV interactions in mosquitoes. IMPORTANCE Area-wide application ofWolbachia to suppress mosquito populations and their transmitted viruses hasachieved success in multiple countries. However, the mass release ofWolbachia-infected male mosquitoes involves a potential risk of accidentallyreleasing fertile females. In this study, we employed ovarian cells of the Ae.albopictus GUA, HC, and GT lines, which exhibit key traits, and compared them to better understand how Wolbachia inhibits ZIKV transovarial transmission. Ourresults showed an almost complete blockade of ZIKV transmission in HC femalemosquitoes. Wolbachia in natively infected GUA mosquitoes negative affected ZIKV,and this interference was shown by slightly lower loads than those in HCmosquitoes. Overall, our work helps show how Wolbachia blocks ZIKV expansion and maintenance in the ovaries of Ae. albopictus and aids in understandingWolbachia-ZIKV interactions in mosquitoes.

AB  - An increase in child malformations in 2015 in Brazil is associated with a Zikavirus spread months earlier, leaving disputes that still echo. Using elementsfrom a sociology field dedicated to scientific controversy mapping, the presentstudy conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with researchers and administratorsinvolved in this causal association. Our work investigated how actors fromdifferent areas observe the role of social conditions in the outcome of theCongenital Zika Syndrome (SCZ) and the paths taken to mitigate them after theepidemic. Concern with social variables and their relevance in the SCZ outcomewas observed, with a widespread disappointment about the referral of these issuesafter the case's peak; however, these factors have not entered the core narrativeabout causality. There are epistemic disputes about this outcome. Some attachresponsibility to the public power or resign themselves to the result; othersdemand more active positions from researchers who had access to thedecision-making process, with disagreements about the positioning of science. Thearticle points out the need for reflective sciences that dialogue with theiragency on the phenomena, as well as for interdisciplinary and multicausalarticulations for public narratives on public health crises in Brazil.

TI  - Usutu Virus Infects Human Placental Explants and Induces Congenital Defects inMice.
LID - 1619 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14081619 [doi]
AB  - Usutu virus (USUV) is a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus that has dispersed quickly in Europe these past years. This arbovirus mainly follows an enzooticcycle involving mosquitoes and birds, but can also infect other mammals, causing notably sporadic cases in humans. Although it is mainly asymptomatic orresponsible for mild clinical symptoms, USUV has been associated withneurological disorders, such as encephalitis and meningoencephalitis,highlighting the potential health threat of this virus. Among the differenttransmission routes described for other flaviviruses, the capacity for some ofthem to be transmitted vertically has been demonstrated, notably for Zika virusor West Nile virus, which are closely related to USUV. To evaluate the ability ofUSUV to replicate in the placenta and gain access to the fetus, we combined theuse of several trophoblast model cell lines, ex vivo human placental explantcultures from first and third trimester of pregnancy, and in vivo USUV-infectedpregnant mice. Our data demonstrate that human placental cells and tissues arepermissive to USUV replication, and suggest that viral transmission can occur in mice during gestation. Hence, our observations suggest that USUV could beefficiently transmitted by the vertical route.

TI  - A Reverse Mutation E143K within the PrM Protein of Zika Virus Asian Lineage NatalRGN Strain Increases Infectivity and Cytopathicity.
LID - 1572 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071572 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in theFlaviviridae, which is classified into two different lineages Asian and African. The outbreak of ZIKV Asian lineage isolates in 2015-2016 is associated with theincrease in cases with prenatal microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome, and hassparked attention throughout the world. Genome sequence alignment and theanalysis of Asian and African lineage isolates indicate that amino acid changes, particular in positively charged amino acid substitutions in the pr region of prMprotein might involve a phenotypic change that links with the global outbreak of ZIKV Asian-lineage. The study generated and characterized the virologicalproperties of wild type and mutants of single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) and infectious clones (i.c.s) of ZIKV Asian-lineage Natal RGN strain, and thenidentified the function of amino acid substitutions at the positions 139[Asn139-->Ser139 (N139S)] and 143 [Glu143-->Lys143 (E143K)] in ZIKV polyproteins (located within the pr region of prM protein) in the infectivity andcytopathogenicity. The E143K SRIP and i.c. of Natal RGN strain exhibitedrelatively higher levels of cytopathic effect, EGFP reporter, viral RNA andprotein synthesis, and virus yield in three types of human cell lines, TE617,SF268 and HMC3, compared to wild type (WT), N139S SRIPs and i.c.s, whichdisplayed more efficiency in replication kinetics. Additionally, E143K Natal RGN i.c. had greater activities of virus attachment and entry, yielded higher titers of intracellular and extracellular virions, and assembled the E proteins near to the plasma membrane in infected cells than the other i.c.s. The results indicate that the positively charged amino acid residue Lys143, a conserved residue in thepr region of prM of ZIKV African lineages, plays a crucial role in viralreplication kinetics, including viral attachment, entry, assembly and egress.Thus, the negatively charged amino acid residue Glu143 within the pr region ofprM leads to an alteration of the phenotypes, in particular, a lower replication efficiency of ZIKV Asian-lineage isolates with the attenuation of infectivity andcytopathicity.

AB  - RT-PCR testing data provides opportunities to explore regional and individualdeterminants of test positivity and surveillance infrastructure. UsingGeneralized Additive Models, we explored 222,515 tests of a random sample ofindividuals with COVID-19 compatible symptoms in the Brazilian state of Bahiaduring 2020. We found that age and male gender were the most significantdeterminants of test positivity. There was evidence of an unequal impact amongsocio-demographic strata, with higher positivity among those living in areas withlow education levels during the first epidemic wave, followed by those living in areas with higher education levels in the second wave. Our estimated probability of testing positive after symptom onset corroborates previous reports that theprobability decreases with time, more than halving by about two weeks andconverging to zero by three weeks. Test positivity rates generally followedstate-level reported cases, and while a single laboratory performed ~90% of testscovering ~99% of the state's area, test turn-around time generally remained belowfour days. This testing effort is a testimony to the Bahian surveillance capacityduring public health emergencies, as previously witnessed during the recent Zika and Yellow Fever outbreaks.

LID - 10.3390/v14071512 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Describing the urodynamic parameters of children aged 3 to 5 years withmicrocephaly related to congenital Zika syndrome and verifying the associationwith clinical, imaging and neurological characteristics. METHODS: From October2018 to March 2020, children with Zika-related microcephaly underwent urological,ultrasonographic and urodynamic evaluation. In selected cases, complementaryexams such as urethrocystography and scintigraphy were performed. The childrenalso underwent a complete neurological evaluation. To compare frequency betweengroups, we used Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: This study evaluated 40 children, of whom 85% were 4 years old, and all hadabnormalities on the urodynamic study, with low bladder capacity (92.5%) anddetrusor overactivity (77.5%) as the most frequent findings. Only three children had ultrasound abnormalities, but no child had cystographic or scintigraphicabnormalities, and the postvoid residual volume was normal in 80% of cases. Inspite of a frequency of 67.5% of intestinal constipation, there was no record of febrile urinary tract infection after the first year of life. All childrenpresented severe microcephaly and at least one neurological abnormality inaddition to microcephaly. The homogeneity of the children in relation tomicrocephaly severity and neurological abnormalities limited the study of theassociation with the urodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Urodynamic abnormalitiesin children aged 3 to 5 years with Zika-related microcephaly do not seem tocharacterize a neurogenic bladder with immediate risks for the upper urinarytract. The satisfactory bladder emptying suggests that the voiding pattern isreflex.

TI  - Reporter Flaviviruses as Tools to Demonstrate Homologous and HeterologousSuperinfection Exclusion.
LID - 1501 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071501 [doi]
AB  - Binjari virus (BinJV) is a lineage II or dual-host affiliated insect-specificflavivirus previously demonstrated as replication-deficient in vertebrate cells. Previous studies have shown that BinJV is tolerant to exchanging its structuralproteins (prM-E) with pathogenic flaviviruses, making it a safe backbone forflavivirus vaccines. Here, we report generation by circular polymerase extension reaction of BinJV expressing zsGreen or mCherry fluorescent protein. RecoveredBinJV reporter viruses grew to high titres (10(7-8) FFU/mL) in Aedes albopictusC6/36 cells assayed using immunoplaque assays (iPA). We also demonstrate thatBinJV reporters could be semi-quantified live in vitro using a fluorescencemicroplate reader with an observed linear correlation between quantifiedfluorescence of BinJV reporter virus-infected C6/36 cells and iPA-quantitatedvirus titres. The utility of the BinJV reporter viruses was then examined inhomologous and heterologous superinfection exclusion assays. We demonstrate that primary infection of C6/36 cells with BinJVzsGreen completely inhibits asecondary infection with homologous BinJVmCherry or heterologous ZIKVmCherryusing fluorescence microscopy and virus quantitation by iPA. Finally,BinJVzsGreen infections were examined in vivo by microinjection of Aedes aegypti with BinJVzsGreen. At seven days post-infection, a strong fluorescence in thevicinity of salivary glands was detected in frozen sections. This is the firstreport on the construction of reporter viruses for lineage II insect-specificflaviviruses and establishes a tractable system for exploring flavivirussuperinfection exclusion in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Understanding Immune Responses to Viruses-Do Underlying Th1/Th2 Cell BiasesPredict Outcome?
LID - 1493 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071493 [doi]
AB  - Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases have increased in number and geographicalextent during the last decades. Examples include the current COVID-19 pandemicand the recent epidemics of the Chikungunya, Ebola, and Zika viruses. Immuneresponses to viruses have been well-characterised within the innate and adaptive immunity pathways with the outcome following viral infection predominantlyattributed to properties of the virus and circumstances of the infection. Perhapsthe belief that the immune system is often considered as a reactive component of host defence, springing into action when a threat is detected, has contributed toa poorer understanding of the inherent differences in an individual's immunesystem in the absence of any pathology. In this review, we focus on how thesehost factors (age, ethnicity, underlying pathologies) may skew the T helper cell response, thereby influencing the outcome following viral infection but alsowhether we can use these inherent biases to predict patients at risk of a deviantresponse and apply strategies to avoid or overcome them.

LID - 1488 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071488 [doi]
AB  - Arbovirus infections are increasingly important causes of disease, whose spectrumof neurological manifestations are not fully known. This study sought toretrospectively assess the incidence of arboviruses in cerebrospinal fluidsamples of patients with neurological symptoms to inform diagnosis of central andperipheral nervous system disorders. A total of 255 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)samples collected from January 2016 to December 2017 were tested for dengue virus(DENV 1-4), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in addition to otherneurotropic arboviruses of interest, using genetic and serologic assays. Of the255 CSF samples analyzed, 3.53% (09/255) were positive for arboviruses presentingmainly as meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebrovascular events, of which ZIKV wasdetected in 2.74% (7/255), DENV in 0.78% (2/255), in addition to an identifiedILHV infection that was described previously. All the cases were detected inadults aged 18 to 74 years old. Our findings highlight the scientific andclinical importance of neurological syndromes associated with arboviruses anddemonstrate the relevance of specific laboratory methods to achieve accuratediagnoses as well as highlight the true dimension of these diseases to ultimatelyimprove public health planning and medical case management.

TI  - Chikungunya Virus Asian Lineage Infection in the Amazon Region Is Maintained byAsiatic and Caribbean-Introduced Variants.
LID - 1445 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071445 [doi]
AB  - The simultaneous transmission of two lineages of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)was discovered after the pathogen's initial arrival in Brazil. In Oiapoque (Amapastate, north Brazil), the Asian lineage (CHIKV-Asian) was discovered, while inBahia state, the East-Central-South-African lineage (CHIKV-ECSA) was discovered(northeast Brazil). Since then, the CHIKV-Asian lineage has been restricted tothe Amazon region (mostly in the state of Amapa), whereas the ECSA lineage hasexpanded across the country. Despite the fact that the Asian lineage was already present in the Amazon region, the ECSA lineage brought from the northeast caused a large outbreak in the Amazonian state of Roraima (north Brazil) in 2017. Here, CHIKV spread in the Amazon region was studied by a Zika-Dengue-Chikungunya PCRassay in 824 serum samples collected between 2013 and 2016 from individuals with symptoms of viral infection in the Amapa state. We found 11 samples positive for CHIKV-Asian, and, from these samples, we were able to retrieve 10 full-lengthviral genomes. A comprehensive phylogenetic study revealed that nine CHIKVsequences came from a local transmission cluster related to Caribbean strains,whereas one sequence was related to sequences from the Philippines. Thesefindings imply that CHIKV spread in different ways in Roraima and Amapa, despite the fact that both states had similar climatic circumstances and mosquito vector frequencies.

TI  - Dynamic Interactions of Post Cleaved NS2B Cofactor and NS3 Protease Identified byIntegrative Structural Approaches.
LID - 1440 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071440 [doi]
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus(WNV), are a serious threat to public health. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved into three structuralproteins and seven non-structural proteins by the viral and cellular proteases.Non-structural (NS) protein 3 is a multifunctional protein that has N-terminalprotease and C-terminal helicase domains. The NS3 protease requires co-factorNS2B for enzymatic activity and folding. Due to its essential role in viralreplication, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs.Despite the availability of crystal structures, dynamic interactions of the N-and C-termini of NS2B co-factor have been elusive due to their flexible fold. In this study, we employ integrative structural approaches combined with biochemicalassays to elucidate the dynamic interactions of the flexible DENV4 NS2B and NS3N- and C-termini. We captured the crystal structure of self-cleaved DENV4NS2B47NS3 protease in post cleavage state. The intermediate conformation adopted in the reported structure can be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. Comparison ofour new findings from DENV4 against previously studied ZIKV NS2B-NS3 proteinsreveals differences in NS2B-NS3 function between the two viruses. No inhibitionof protease activity was observed for unlinked DENV NS2B-NS3 in presence of thecleavage site while ZIKV NS2B-NS3 cleavage inhibits protease activity. Anotherdifference is that binding of the NS2B C-terminus to DENV4 eNS2B47NS3Pro activesite is mediated via interactions with P4-P6 residues while for ZIKV, the bindingof NS2B C-terminus to active site is mediated by P1-P3 residues. The mapping ofNS2B N- and C-termini with NS3 indicates that these intermolecular interactionsoccur mainly on the beta-barrel 2 of the NS3 protease domain. Our integrativeapproach enables a comprehensive understanding of the folding and dynamicinteractions of DENV NS3 protease and its cofactor NS2B.

LID - 10.3390/v14071418 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are members of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses and cause severe disease in humans. ZIKV and DENV share over 90%of their genome sequences, however, the clinical features of Zika and dengueinfections are very different reflecting tropism and cellular effects. Here, weused simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting to define thetranscriptional and translational dynamics of ZIKV and DENV infection in humanneuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). The gene expression data showed induction ofaminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) and the translation activating PIM1 kinase,indicating an increase in RNA translation capacity. The data also revealactivation of different cell stress responses, with ZIKV triggering a BACH1/2redox program, and DENV activating the ATF/CHOP endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressprogram. The RNA translation data highlight activation of polyamine metabolismthrough changes in key enzymes and their regulators. This pathway is needed foreIF5A hypusination and has been implicated in viral translation and replication. Concerning the viral RNA genomes, ribosome occupancy readily identified highlytranslated open reading frames and a novel upstream ORF (uORF) in the DENVgenome. Together, our data highlight both the cellular stress response and theactivation of RNA translation and polyamine metabolism during DENV and ZIKVinfection.

AB  - The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system regulates numerous biologicalprocesses, including protein localization, stability and/or activity,transcription, and DNA repair. SUMO also plays critical roles in innate immunity and antiviral defense by mediating interferon (IFN) synthesis and signaling, aswell as the expression and function of IFN-stimulated gene products. Virusesincluding human immunodeficiency virus-1, Zika virus, herpesviruses, andcoronaviruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation system to counteractthe antiviral activities of SUMO proteins and to modify their own proteins forviral persistence and pathogenesis. Understanding the exploitation of SUMO isnecessary for the development of effective antiviral therapies. This reviewsummarizes the interplay between viruses and the host SUMOylation system, with a special emphasis on viruses with neuro-invasive properties that have pathogenicconsequences on the central nervous system.

TI  - Serological Evidence of Zika Virus Circulation in Burkina Faso.
LID - 741 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070741 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are two closely related members of the Flaviviridae family, both transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, and areamong the arboviruses most at risk to human health. Burkina Faso has been facing an upsurge in DENV outbreaks since 2013. Unlike DENV, there is no serologicalevidence of ZIKV circulation in humans in Burkina Faso. The main objective of ourstudy was to determine the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV in blood donors inBurkina Faso. A total of 501 donor samples collected in the two major cities ofthe country in 2020 were first tested by a competitive enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay to detect flavivirus antibodies. Positive sera were thentested using Luminex to detect ZIKV and DENV antibodies and virus-specificmicroneutralization tests against ZIKV were performed. The ZIKV seroprevalencewas 22.75% in the donor samples and we found seropositivity for allDENV-serotypes ranging from 19.56% for DENV-1 to 48.86% for DENV-2. Molecularanalyses performed on samples from febrile patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes between 2019 and 2021 were negative. Our study showed the important circulationof ZIKV and DENV detected by serology although molecular evidence of thecirculation of ZIKV could not be demonstrated. It is essential to strengthenexisting arbovirus surveillance in Burkina Faso and more broadly in West Africaby focusing on fevers of unknown origin and integrating vector surveillance toassess the extent of ZIKV circulation and identify the circulating strain.Further studies are needed to better understand the epidemiology of this virus inorder to define appropriate prevention and response methods.

TI  - A Chikungunya Virus Multiepitope Recombinant Protein Expressed from the BinarySystem Insect Cell/Recombinant Baculovirus Is Useful for Laboratorial Diagnosisof Chikungunya.
LID - 1451 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071451 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus currently distributed worldwide,causing a disease that shares clinical signs and symptoms with other illnesses,such as dengue and Zika and leading to a challenging clinical differentialdiagnosis. In Brazil, CHIKV emerged in 2014 with the simultaneous introduction ofboth Asian and East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotypes. Laboratorialdiagnosis of CHIKV is mainly performed by molecular and serological assays, with the latter more widely used. Although many commercial kits are available, theircosts are still high for many underdeveloped and developing countries where thevirus circulates. Here we described the development and evaluation of amulti-epitope recombinant protein-based IgG-ELISA (MULTREC IgG-ELISA) test forthe specific detection of anti-CHIKV antibodies in clinical samples, as analternative approach for laboratorial diagnosis. The MULTREC IgG-ELISA showed86.36% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity, and no cross-reactivity with otherexanthematic diseases was observed. The recombinant protein was expressed fromthe binary system insect cell/baculovirus using the crystal-forming baculoviralprotein polyhedrin as a carrier of the target recombinant protein to facilitaterecovery. The crystals were at least 10 times smaller in size and had anamorphous shape when compared to the polyhedrin wild-type crystal. The assay usesa multi-epitope antigen, representing two replicates of 18 amino acid sequencesfrom the E2 region and a sequence of 17 amino acids from the nsP3 region ofCHIKV. The recombinant protein was highly expressed, easy to purify and hasdemonstrated its usefulness in confirming chikungunya exposure, indeed showing a good potential tool for epidemiological surveillance.

TI  - Riboflavin, a Potent Neuroprotective Vitamin: Focus on Flavivirus and Alphavirus Proteases.
LID - 1331 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071331 [doi]
AB  - Several neurotropic viruses are members of the flavivirus and alphavirusfamilies. Infections caused by these viruses may cause long-term neurologicalsequelae in humans. The continuous emergence of infections caused by virusesaround the world, such as the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Alphavirus genus), thezika virus (ZIKV) and the yellow fever virus (YFV) (both of the Flavivirusgenus), warrants the development of new strategies to combat them. Our studydemonstrates the inhibitory potential of the water-soluble vitamin riboflavinagainst NS2B/NS3(pro) of ZIKV and YFV and nsP2(pro) of CHIKV. Riboflavin presentsa competitive inhibition mode with IC50 values in the medium microM range of 79.4+/- 5.0 microM for ZIKV NS2B/NS3(pro) and 45.7 +/- 2.9 muM for YFV NS2B/NS3(pro).Against CHIKV nsP2(pro), the vitamin showed a very strong effect (93 +/- 5.7 nM).The determined dissociation constants (KD) are significantly below the threshold value of 30 microM. The ligand binding increases the thermal stability between 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C. Unexpectedly, riboflavin showed inhibiting activityagainst another viral protein; the molecule was also able to inhibit the viralentry of CHIKV. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated great stability ofriboflavin in the protease active site, which validates the repurposing ofriboflavin as a promising molecule in drug development against the virusespresented here.

LID - 10.3390/metabo12070641 [doi]
AB  - Several relatively recently published studies have shown changes in plasmametabolites in various viral diseases such as Zika, Dengue, RSV or SARS-CoV-1.The aim of this study was to analyze the metabolome profile of patients duringacute COVID-19 approximately one month after the acute infection and to comparethese results with healthy (SARS-CoV-2-negative) controls. The metabolomeanalysis was performed by NMR spectroscopy from the peripheral blood of patients and controls. The blood samples were collected on 3 different occasions (atadmission, during hospitalization and on control visit after discharge from thehospital). When comparing sample groups (based on the date of acquisition) tocontrols, there is an indicative shift in metabolomics features based on the timepassed after the first sample was taken towards controls. Based on the randomforest algorithm, there is a strong discriminatory predictive value betweencontrols and different sample groups (AUC equals 1 for controls versus samplestaken at admission, Mathew correlation coefficient equals 1). Significantmetabolomic changes persist in patients more than a month after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The random forest algorithm shows very strong discrimination (almostideal) when comparing metabolite levels of patients in two various stages ofdisease and during the recovery period compared to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls.

TI  - New Anti-Flavivirus Fusion Loop Human Antibodies with Zika Virus-NeutralizingPotential.
LID - 7805 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147805 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus infections exhibit recurrent outbreaks and can be responsible fordisease complications such as congenital Zika virus syndrome. Effectivetherapeutic interventions are still a challenge. Antibodies can providesignificant protection, although the antibody response may fail due toantibody-dependent enhancement reactions. The choice of the target antigen is acrucial part of the process to generate effective neutralizing antibodies. Human anti-Zika virus antibodies were selected by phage display technology. Theantibodies were selected against a mimetic peptide based on the fusion loopregion in the protein E of Zika virus, which is highly conserved among different flaviviruses. Four rounds of selection were performed using the synthetic peptidein two strategies: the first was using the acidic elution of bound phages, andthe second was by applying a competing procedure. After panning, the selected VH and VL domains were determined by combining NGS and bioinformatic approaches.Three different human monoclonal antibodies were expressed as scFvs and furthercharacterized. All showed a binding capacity to Zika (ZIKV) and showedcross-recognition with yellow fever (YFV) and dengue (DENV) viruses. Two of theseantibodies, AZ1p and AZ6m, could neutralize the ZIKV infection in vitro. Due tothe conservation of the fusion loop region, these new antibodies can potentially be used in therapeutic intervention against Zika virus and other flavivirusillnesses.

TI  - Survivorship-Reducing Effect of Propylene Glycol on Vector Mosquito Populationsand Its Potential Use in Attractive Toxic Sugar Baits.
LID - 595 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13070595 [doi]
AB  - Arthropod control mechanisms are a vital part of public health measures aroundthe world as many insect species serve as vectors for devastating human diseases.Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is a widely distributed, medically importantmosquito species that transmits viruses such as yellow fever, Dengue, and Zika.Many traditional control mechanisms have become less effective due to insecticideresistance or exhibit unwanted off-target effects, and, consequently, there is a need for novel solutions. The use of attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSBs) hasincreased in recent years, though the toxic elements are often harmful to humans and other vertebrates. Therefore, we are investigating propylene glycol, asubstance that is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption. Using a series of feeding assays, we found that propylene glycol is highly toxic to Ae.aegypti adults and a single day of exposure significantly reduces thesurvivorship of test populations compared with controls. The effects are morepronounced in males, drastically reducing their survivorship after one day ofconsumption. Additionally, the consumption of propylene glycol reduced thesurvivorship of two prominent disease vectors: Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) andCulex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758). These findings indicate that propylene glycolcould be used as a safe and effective alternative to pesticides in an ATSBsystem.

TI  - High Glucose Induces in HK2 Kidney Cells an IFN-Dependent ZIKV Antiviral StatusFueled by Viperin.
LID - 1577 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071577 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that rapidly became a major medical concern worldwide. We have recently reported that a high glucoselevel decreases the rate of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication with an impact on humankidney HK-2 cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which cells cultured in ahigh glucose medium inhibit ZIKV growth remain unclear. Viperin belongs tointerferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and its expression is highly up-regulated upon viral infection, leading to antiviral activity against a variety of viruses,including flaviviruses. As such, viperin has been shown to be a major actorinvolved in the innate immune response against Zika virus (ZIKV). Our presentstudy aims to further characterize the involvement of viperin in ZIKV growthinhibition under high glucose concentration (HK-2(HGC)). We show for the firsttime that endogenous viperin is over-expressed in HK-2 cells cultured under high glucose concentration (HK-2(HGC)), which is associated with ZIKV growthinhibition. Viperin knockdown in HK-2(HGC) rescues ZIKV growth. In addition, our results emphasize that up-regulated viperin in HK-2(HGC) leads to ZIKV growthinhibition through the stimulation of IFN-beta production. In summary, our workprovides new insights into the ZIKV growth inhibition mechanism observed in HK-2 cells cultured in a high glucose environment.

LID - 10.3390/bios12070501 [doi]
AB  - Integrated biosensor platforms have become subjects of high interest forconsolidated assay preparation and analysis to reduce sample-to-answer responsetimes. By compactly combining as many biosensor processes and functions aspossible into a single lab-on-chip device, all-in-one point-of-care devices canaid in the accessibility and speed of deployment due to their compact size andportability. Biomarker assay preparation and sensing are functionalities that areoften carried out on separate devices, thus increasing opportunity ofcontamination, loss of sample volume, and other forms of error. Here, wedemonstrate a complete lab-on-chip system combining sample preparation, on-chipoptofluidic dye laser, and optical detection. We first show the integration of anon-chip distributed feedback dye laser for alignment-free optical excitation ofparticles moving through a fluidic channel. This capability is demonstrated byusing Rhodamine 6G as the gain medium to excite single fluorescent microspheresat 575 nm. Next, we present an optofluidic PDMS platform combining a microvalvenetwork (automaton) for sample preparation of nanoliter volumes, on-chipdistributed feedback dye laser for target excitation, and optical detection. Weconduct concurrent capture and fluorescence tagging of Zika virus nucleic acid onmagnetic beads in 30 min. Target-carrying beads are then optically excited using the on-chip laser as they flow through an analysis channel, followed by highlyspecific fluorescence detection. This demonstration of a complete all-in-onebiosensor is a tangible step in the development of a rapid, point-of-care device that can assist in limiting the severity of future outbreaks.

TI  - Arbovirus risk perception as a predictor of mosquito-bite preventive behaviors inPonce, Puerto Rico.
PG  - e0010653
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010653 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne arboviruses are an important cause of morbidity and mortality inthe Caribbean. In Puerto Rico, chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses have eachcaused large outbreaks during 2010-2022. To date, the majority of controlmeasures to prevent these diseases focus on mosquito control and many requirecommunity participation. In 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control andPrevention launched the COPA project, a community-based cohort study in Ponce,Puerto Rico, to measure the impact of novel vector control interventions inreducing arboviral infections. Randomly selected households from 38 designatedcluster areas were offered participation, and baseline data were collected from2,353 households between May 2018 and May 2019. Household-level responses wereprovided by one representative per home. Cross-sectional analyses of baselinedata were conducted to estimate 1) the association between arboviral riskperception and annual household expenditure on mosquito control, and 2) theassociation between arboviral risk perception and engagement in >/=3household-level risk reduction behaviors. In this study, 27% of householdrepresentatives believed their household was at high risk of arboviruses and 36% of households engaged in at least three of the six household-level preventivebehaviors. Households where the representative perceived their household at high risk spent an average of $35.9 (95% confidence interval: $23.7, $48.1) moreannually on mosquito bite prevention compared to households where therepresentative perceived no risk. The probability of engaging in >/=3household-level mosquito-preventive behaviors was 10.2 percentage points greater (7.2, 13.0) in households where the representatives perceived high risk compared to those in which the representatives perceived no risk. Paired with otherresearch, these results support investment in community-based participatoryapproaches to mosquito control and providing accessible information forcommunities to accurately interpret their risk.

AB  - Aedes-borne viruses, yellow fever, dengue, Chikungunya and Zika are taking a hugetoll on global health as Africa faces re-emergence with potential for massivehuman catastrophe. Transmission driven by diverse vectors in ecological settings that range from urban to rural and sylvatic habitats with human and non-humanprimate/reservoir activities across such habitats have facilitated virus movementand spill over to susceptible human populations. Approved vaccine exists for YFalthough availability for routine and mass vaccination is often constrained.Integrating vector surveillance, understanding disease ecology with rationalised vaccination in high-risk areas (YF) remains important in disease prevention andcontrol. We review trends in disease occurrence in Africa, hinting on gaps indisease detection and management and the prospects for prevention and/or control.

AB  - Simultaneous spatial circulation of urban arboviral diseases, such as dengue,chikungunya, and Zika, is a major challenge. In this ecological study of urbanarboviruses performed from 2015 to 2019, we analyzed the spatial and temporaldynamics of these arboviruses in all 92 municipalities and nine health regions ofRio de Janeiro state. Annual cumulative incidences are presented for all threearboviruses throughout the study period. Spatial analyses of the three studiedarboviruses showed distinct behaviors among municipalities and health regions.Co-circulation of the three arboviruses in the state and a heterogeneousspatiotemporal pattern was observed for each disease and region, with denguehaving a higher annual incidence during the five years of the study, as well astwo consecutive epidemic years in the state. The increase in transmission indifferent regions of the state in one year culminated in an epidemic in the statein the following year. A high annual cumulative incidence of chikungunya occurredin municipalities from 2017 to 2019 and of Zika only in 2016. Some municipalitieswith higher population densities showed higher incidences for some arbovirusesand appeared to contribute to the dissemination to cities of lower demographicdensity and maintenance of these urban arboviruses. Thus, regions recordingincreased incidences of the three diseases in their territories for long periods should be considered municipal poles, as they initiated and sustained hightransmission within their region.

TI  - Observing the distribution of mosquito bites on humans to inform personalprotection measures against malaria and dengue vectors.
PG  - e0271833
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271833 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding mosquito biting behaviours is important for designingand evaluating protection methods against nuisance biting and mosquito-bornediseases (e.g. dengue, malaria and zika). We investigated the preferred bitingsites by Aedes aegypti and Anopheles arabiensis on adult volunteers in standingor sleeping positions; and estimated the theoretical protection limits affordablefrom protective clothing or repellent-treated footwear. METHODS: Adult volunteersdressed in shorts and t-shirts were exposed to infection-free laboratory-rearedmosquitoes inside screened chambers from 6am to noon (for day-biting Ae. aegypti)or 6pm to midnight (night-biting An. arabiensis). Attempted bites on differentbody parts were recorded. Comparative observations were made on same volunteerswhile wearing sandals treated with transfluthrin, a vapour-phase pyrethroid that kills and repels mosquitoes. RESULTS: An. arabiensis bites were mainly on thelower limbs of standing volunteers (95.9% of bites below the knees) butevenly-distributed over all exposed body surfaces when the volunteers were onsleeping positions (only 28.8% bites below knees). Ae. aegypti bites wereslightly concentrated on lower limbs of standing volunteers (47.7% below knees), but evenly-distributed on sleeping volunteers (23.3% below knees). Wearingprotective clothing that leave only hands and head uncovered (e.g. socks +trousers + long-sleeved shirts) could theoretically prevent 78-83% of bitesduring sleeping, and at least 90% of bites during non-sleeping hours. If the feetare also exposed, protection declines to as low as 36.3% against Anopheles. Theexperiments showed that transfluthrin-treated sandals reduced An. arabiensis by54-86% and Ae. aegypti by 32-39%, but did not change overall distributions ofbites. CONCLUSION: Biting by An. arabiensis and Ae. aegypti occur mainly on thelower limbs, though this proclivity is less pronounced in the Aedes species.However, when hosts are on sleeping positions, biting by both species is moreevenly-distributed over the exposed body surfaces. High personal protection mightbe achieved by simply wearing long-sleeved clothing, though protection againstAnopheles particularly requires covering of feet and lower legs. Thetransfluthrin-treated footwear can reduce biting risk, especially by An.arabiensis. These findings could inform the design and use of personal protectiontools (both insecticidal and non-insecticidal) against mosquitoes andmosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - HLA-G, LILRB1 and LILRB2 Variants in Zika Virus Transmission from Mother to Childin a Population from South and Southeast of Brazil.
PG  - 2783-2793
LID - 10.3390/cimb44070191 [doi]
AB  - During the 2015-2016 epidemic, Brazil was the country with the highest rate ofZika virus (ZIKV) infection in the Americas. Twenty-nine percent of pregnantwomen positive for ZIKV exhibited ultrasound scans with fetus anomalies. Humanleukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) exerts immunoregulatory effects by binding toinhibitory receptors, namely LILRB1 and LILRB2, thus preventing mother-fetusrejection and vertical pathogen transmission. The binding of HLA-G to one of its receptors modulates both innate and adaptive immunity. However, in a viralinfection, these molecules may behave as pathogenic mediators shifting thepregnancy environment from an anti-inflammatory profile to a pro-inflammatoryphenotype. Genetic mutations might be associated with the change in phenotype.This study aimed to explore the possible role of polymorphic sites in HLA-G,LILRB1 and LILRB2 in mother-fetus ZIKV transmission. Polymorphisms were detected by direct sequencing. Differences in allele and/or genotype frequencies for each SNP analyzed among ZIKV non-transmitting and transmitting mother-child pairs,among ZIKV-transmitting and non-transmitting mothers and between ZIKV-infectedand non-infected children were compared by Mid-P exact test or Yates' correction.Significant susceptibility of ZIKV vertical transmission is suggested inZIKV-transmitting and non-transmitting mothers and ZIKV-infected and non-infectedchildren for LILRB1_rs1061684 T/T (p = 0.03, Pc = 0.06, OR = 12.4; p = 0.008, Pc = 0.016, OR = 16.4) and LILRB1_rs16985478 A/A (p = 0.01, Pc = 0.02, OR = 19.2; p = 0.008, Pc = 0.016, OR = 16.4). HLA-G_rs1710 (p = 0.04, Pc = 0.52, OR = 4.30)was also a susceptibility factor. LILRB2_rs386056 G/A (p = 0.02, Pc = 0.08, OR = 0.07), LILRB2_rs7247451 G/G (p = 0.01, Pc = 0.04, OR = 0.04) and HLAG_rs9380142T/T (p = 0.04, Pc = 0.52, OR = 0.14) were suggested as protective factors againstvertical transmission. The current study suggests that polymorphic sites in theLILRB1 and HLA-G genes might be associated with mother-to-child ZIKV transmissionwhile LILRB2 might be associated with protection against ZIKV transmission in thewomb in a population from the south and southeast of Brazil.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of [(18)F]FDG-PET as a biomarker of lymphoid tissuedisease and inflammation in Zika virus infection.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05892-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Zika (ZIKV) is a viral inflammatory disease affecting adults, children, and developing fetuses. It is endemic to tropical and sub-tropical countries,resulting in half the global population at risk of infection. Despite this, thereare no approved therapies or vaccines against ZIKV disease. Non-invasive imaging biomarkers are potentially valuable tools for studying viral pathogenesis,prognosticating host response to disease, and evaluating in vivo efficacy ofexperimental therapeutic interventions. In this study, we evaluated[(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) as animaging biomarker of ZIKV disease in a mouse model and correlated metabolictracer tissue uptake with real-time biochemical, virological, and inflammatoryfeatures of tissue infection. METHODS: [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT imaging was performed inan acute, lethal ZIKV mouse infection model, at increasing stages of diseaseseverity. [(18)F]FDG-PET findings were corroborated with ex vivowholemount-tissue autoradiography and tracer biodistribution studies. Traceruptake was also correlated with in situ tissue disease status, including viralburden and inflammatory response. Immune profiling of the spleen by flowcytometry was performed to identify the immune cell subsets driving tissuepathology and enhancing tracer uptake in ZIKV disease. RESULTS: Foci of increased[(18)F]FDG uptake were consistently detected in lymphoid tissues-particularly thespleen-of ZIKV-infected animals. Splenic uptake increased with disease severity, and corroborated findings in tissue pathology. Increased splenic uptake alsocorrelated with increased viral replication and elevated expression ofpro-inflammatory cytokines within these tissues. ZIKV-infected spleens werecharacterized by increased infiltration of myeloid cells, as well as increasedproliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. The increased cellproliferation correlated with increased tracer uptake in the spleen. Our findingssupport the use of [(18)F]FDG as an imaging biomarker to detect and track ZIKVdisease in real time and highlight the dependency of affected tissue on thenature of the viral infection. CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FDG uptake in the spleen is auseful surrogate for interrogating in situ tissue viral burden and inflammationstatus in this ZIKV murine model.

PG  - 924334
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.924334 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a globally important arbovirus. The virus isprimarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infective Aedes albopictusin temperate area. Vertical transmission of ZIKV by Ae. albopictus is determined and has been suggested to be a means by which the virus could persist in nature. Ae. albopictus undergoes a well-characterized photoperiodic diapause. Viruses areharbored by overwintering mosquitoes in diapause that contributes to theresurgence of vertebrate diseases in the following spring, yet little is knownabout the impact of diapause on the regulation of viral replication and survival.The purpose of this study is to determine that Ae. albopictus in Beijing arehighly susceptible to ZIKV (92.3%), and viable virus is passed to their organs ofprogeny via vertical transmission. Moreover, diapause eggs (diapause incidence97.8%) had significantly lower minimum infection rates and filial infection ratesof the first gonotrophic cycle than those of the second gonotrophic cycle in the short-day photoperiod group. Regarding the development of diapause eggs, theminimum infection rates and ZIKV RNA copy number increased significantly,suggesting that virus RNA replication occurred in the diapause eggs. Meanwhile,eggs from the ZIKV-infected mosquitoes had a significantly lower hatching ratecompared with uninfected mosquitoes, implying an intriguing interaction betweendiapause eggs and virus. The findings here suggest that vertical transmission of ZIKV from diapause eggs to progeny may have a critical epidemiological role inthe dissemination and maintenance of ZIKV circulating in the vector.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging flavivirus that leads to devastatingconsequences for fetal development. It is crucial to visualize the pathogenicity activities of ZIKV ranging from infection pathways to immunity processes, but theaccurate labeling of ZIKV remains challenging due to the lack of a reliablelabeling technique. We introduce the photo-activated bio-orthogonal cycloadditionto construct a fluorogenic probe for the labeling and visualizing of ZIKV. Via a simple UV photoirradiation, the fluorogenic probes could be effectively labeledon the ZIKV. We demonstrated that it can be used for investigating theinteraction between ZIKV and diverse cells and avoiding the autofluorescencephenomenon in traditional immunofluorescence assay. Thus, thisbioorthogonal-enabled labeling strategy can serve as a promising approach tomonitor and understand the interaction between the ZIKV and host cells.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the presence and persistence of neurological andneuropsychological sequelae among children with acquired Zika virus infection andassess whether those sequelae were more common in children infected with Zikavirus compared to uninfected children. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohortstudy of children with and without Zika virus infection in Leon, Nicaragua, usinga standard clinical assessment tool and questionnaire to collect data on symptomsat three visits, about 6 months apart, and a battery of standardized instruments to evaluate neurocognitive function, behavior, depression, and anxiety at thelast two visits. Results: Sixty-two children were enrolled, with no significantdifferences in demographics by infection group. Children infected with Zika virushad a range of neurological symptoms, some of which persisted for 6 to 12 months;however, no consistent pattern of symptoms was observed. At baseline a smallpercentage of children infected with Zika virus had an abnormal finger-to-nosetest (13%), cold touch response (13%), and vibration response (15%) versus 0% in the uninfected group. Neurocognitive deficits and behavioral problems were commonin both groups, with no significant differences between the groups. Childreninfected with Zika virus had lower cognitive efficiency scores at the 6-monthvisit. Anxiety and depression were infrequent in both groups. Conclusions: Largerstudies are needed to definitively investigate the relationship between Zikavirus infection and neurological symptoms and neurocognitive problems, withadjustment for factors affecting cognition and behavior, including mood and sleepdisorders, home learning environment, history of neuroinvasive infections, anddetailed family history of neuropsychological problems.

AB  - Introduction: Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are viral diseases that pose aconstant threat to public health. These three arboviruses can produce verysimilar clinical pictures, which represents a challenge to achieving an accurate clinical diagnosis and can lead to inadequate management and even fatal outcomes.Guidelines for the Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Dengue, Chikungunya, andZika is part of the effort by the Pan American Health Organization and thecountries of the Region of the Americas to prevent severe cases and death fromthese diseases, in a complex epidemiological context in which multiple factorsfavor transmission dynamics and lead to outbreaks and epidemics in the countries of the Region. Objectives: Synthesize the recommendations in the PAHO guidelines,published in 2022, in order to present appropriate diagnosis and treatment ofthese arboviruses, and to address aspects of implementation of therecommendations. Methods: The guidelines and their recommendations weresynthesized. In addition, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs,Health Systems Evidence, Epistemonikos, and gray literature for studies done inthe Region of the Americas, in order to identify barriers, facilitators, andimplementation strategies. Process and outcome indicators for implementation ofthe recommendations were identified and formulated. Results: We present 12recommendations applicable to adult and pediatric patients with suspected orconfirmed dengue, chikungunya, or Zika, along with barriers, facilitators, andstrategies for their implementation. Conclusions: The recommendations providestrategies for timely diagnosis and treatment of acute cases of dengue,chikungunya, and Zika, as well as considerations for implementation of thestrategies.

AB  - In addition to antibacterial effects, macrolide antibiotics exhibit otherextensive pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviralactivities. Erythromycin estolate, one of the macrolide antibiotics, waspreviously investigated to effectively inhibit infections of various flavivirusesincluding Zika virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus, but its antiviraleffect against human coronavirus remains unknown. Thus, the current study wasdesigned to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of erythromycin estolate againsthuman coronavirus strain OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and to illustrate the underlyingmechanisms. Erythromycin estolate effectively inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection indifferent cell types and significantly reduced virus titers at safe concentrationwithout cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, erythromycin estolate was identified toinhibit HCoV-OC43 infection at the early stage and to irreversibly inactivatevirus by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane whose lipid componentmight be the target of action. Together, it was demonstrated that erythromycinestolate could be a potential therapeutic drug for HCoV-OC43 infection.

TI  - Interspecies Isobaric Labeling-Based Quantitative Proteomics Reveals ProteinChanges in the Ovary of Aedes aegypti Coinfected With ZIKV and Wolbachia.
PG  - 900608

AB  - Zika is a vector-borne disease caused by an arbovirus (ZIKV) and overwhelminglytransmitted by Ae. aegypti. This disease is linked to adverse fetal outcomes,mostly microcephaly in newborns, and other clinical aspects such as acute febrileillness and neurologic complications, for example, Guillain-Barre syndrome. Oneof the most promising strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission involvesreleasing Ae. aegypti mosquitoes carrying the maternally inherited endosymbiontbacteria Wolbachia pipientis. The presence of Wolbachia is associated with areduced susceptibility to arboviruses and a fitness cost in mosquito life-historytraits such as fecundity and fertility. However, the mechanisms by whichWolbachia influences metabolic pathways leading to differences in egg production remains poorly known. To investigate the impact of coinfections on thereproductive tract of the mosquito, we applied an isobaric labeling-basedquantitative proteomic strategy to investigate the influence of Wolbachia wMeland ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti ovaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete proteome of Ae. aegypti ovaries reported so far, with a totalof 3913 proteins identified, were also able to quantify 1044 Wolbachia proteinsin complex sample tissue of Ae. aegypti ovary. Furthermore, from a total of 480mosquito proteins modulated in our study, we discuss proteins and pathwaysaltered in Ae. aegypti during ZIKV infections, Wolbachia infections, coinfection Wolbachia/ZIKV, and compared with no infection, focusing on immune andreproductive aspects of Ae. aegypti. The modified aspects mainly were related to the immune priming enhancement by Wolbachia presence and the modulation of theJuvenile Hormone pathway caused by both microorganism's infection.

LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.921060 [doi]
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) protease is an attractive drug target for the design ofnovel inhibitors to control the ZIKV infection. As the protease substrate-bindingsite contains acidic residues, inhibitors with basic residues can be beneficialfor the inhibition of protease activities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation andmolecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA)techniques are employed herein to design potent peptide inhibitors and tounderstand the nature of the basic residues that can potentially stabilize theacidic residues of the protease substrate-binding site. It is found that theinclusion of K, R, and K at P1, P2, and P3 positions, respectively, and Y at the P4 position (YKRK) would generate a highly stable tetrapeptide-protease complexwith a DeltaGbind of ~ -80 kcal/mol. We have also shown that the C-terminalextension of this and the second most stable tetrapeptide (YRRR) with small polarresidues, such as S and T would generate even more stable hexapeptide-proteasecomplexes. The modes of interactions of these inhibitors are discussed in detail,which are in agreement with earlier experimental studies. Thus, this study isexpected to aid in the design of novel antiviral drugs against the ZIKV.

AB  - More than half of the global population lives in areas where the Aedes aegyptimosquito is present. Efforts have been made to deal with the population of thismosquito in the larval and adult stages to prevent outbreaks of diseases (Dengue,Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever). In this scenario, photodynamic inactivationmay be an effective alternative method to control this vector population. Toevaluate the efficacy of the riboflavin - B2 vitamin - as photosensitizer (PS) inthe photodynamic inactivation of Ae. aegypti larvae, different concentrations (0;0.005; 0.010; 0.025; 0.050; 0.075 and 0.100 mg mL(-1)) were evaluated under whitelight from RGB LEDs at a light dose of 495.2 J cm(-2). The results reveal thatriboflavin can be successfully applied as a PS agent to photoinactivate Ae.aegypti larvae, showing its potential to deal with the larvae population.

AB  - The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins broadly inhibit the entryof diverse pathogenic viruses, including Influenza A virus (IAV), Zika virus,HIV-1, and SARS coronaviruses by inhibiting virus-cell membrane fusion. IFITM3was previously shown to disrupt cholesterol trafficking, but the functionalrelationship between IFITM3 and cholesterol remains unclear. We previously showedthat inhibition of IAV entry by IFITM3 is associated with its ability to promote cellular membrane rigidity, and these activities are functionally linked by ashared requirement for the amphipathic helix (AH) found in the intramembranedomain (IMD) of IFITM3. Furthermore, it has been shown that the AH of IFITM3alters lipid membranes in vitro in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between IFITM3 and cholesterol in moredetail. Using a fluorescence-based in vitro binding assay, we found that apeptide derived from the AH of IFITM3 directly interacted with the cholesterolanalog, NBD-cholesterol, while other regions of the IFITM3 IMD did not, andnative cholesterol competed with this interaction. In addition, recombinantfull-length IFITM3 protein also exhibited NBD-cholesterol binding activity.Importantly, previously characterized mutations within the AH of IFITM3 thatstrongly inhibit antiviral function (F63Q and F67Q) disrupted AH structure insolution, inhibited cholesterol binding in vitro, and restricted bilayerinsertion in silico. Our data suggest that direct interactions with cholesterolmay contribute to the inhibition of membrane fusion pore formation by IFITM3.These findings may facilitate the design of therapeutic peptides for use inbroad-spectrum antiviral therapy.

TI  - ANKLE2-related microcephaly: A variable microcephaly syndrome resembling Zikainfection.
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51629 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum ofANKLE2-related microcephaly (MIC), as well as highlights shared pathologicalmechanisms between ANKLE2 and the Zika virus. METHODS: We identified 12individuals with MIC and variants in ANKLE2 with a broad range of features.Probands underwent thorough phenotypic evaluations, developmental assessments,and anthropometric measurements. Brain imaging studies were systematicallyreviewed for developmental abnormalities. We functionally interrogated a subsetof identified ANKLE2 variants in Drosophila melanogaster. RESULTS: Allindividuals had MIC (z-score </= -3), including nine with congenital MIC. Weidentified a broad range of brain abnormalities including simplified corticalgyral pattern, full or partial callosal agenesis, increased extra-axial spaces,hypomyelination, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and enlarged cisterna magna. Allprobands had developmental delays in at least one domain, with speech andlanguage delays being the most common. Six probands had skin findingscharacteristic of ANKLE2 including hyper- and hypopigmented macules. Only oneindividual had scalp rugae. Functional characterization in Drosophilarecapitulated the human MIC phenotype. Of the four variants tested, p.Val229Gly, p.Arg236*, and p.Arg536Cys acted as partial-loss-of-function variants, whereasthe c.1421-1G>C splicing variant demonstrated a strong loss-of-function effect.INTERPRETATION: Deleterious variants in the ANKLE2 gene cause a unique MICsyndrome characterized by congenital or postnatal MIC, a broad range ofstructural brain abnormalities, and skin pigmentary changes. Thorough functional characterization has identified shared pathogenic mechanisms betweenANKLE2-related MIC and congenital Zika virus infection. This study furtherhighlights the importance of a thorough diagnostic evaluation including moleculardiagnostic testing in individuals with MIC.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus associated with neurologicaldisorders. Currently, no specific vaccines or antivirals are available to treatthe ZIKV infection. Ouabain, a cardiotonic steroid known as Na(+)/K(+)-ATPaseinhibitor, has been previously described as an immunomodulatory substance by our group. Here, we evaluated for the first time the antiviral activity of thispromising substance against a Brazilian ZIKV strain. Vero cells were treated withdifferent concentrations of ouabain before and after the infection with ZIKV. Theantiviral effect was evaluated by the TCID50 method and RT-qPCR. Ouabainpresented a dose-dependent inhibitory effect against ZIKV, mainly when added postinfection. The reduction of infectious virus was accompanied by a decrease inZIKV RNA levels, suggesting that the mechanism of ZIKV inhibition by ouabainoccurred at the replication step. In addition, our in silico data demonstrated a conformational stability and favorable binding free energy of ouabain in thebiding sites of the NS5-RdRp and NS3-helicase proteins, which could be related toits mechanism of action. Taken together, these data demonstrate the antiviralactivity of ouabain against a Brazilian ZIKV strain and evidence the potential ofcardiotonic steroids as promising antiviral agents.

TI  - Attempts to use breeding approaches in Aedes aegypti to create lines withdistinct and stable relative Wolbachia densities.
LID - 10.1038/s41437-022-00553-x [doi]
AB  - Wolbachia is an insect endosymbiont being used for biological control in themosquito Aedes aegypti because it causes cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) andlimits viral replication of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. While thegenetic mechanism of pathogen blocking (PB) is not fully understood, the strengthof both CI and PB are positively correlated with Wolbachia densities in the host.Wolbachia densities are determined by a combination of Wolbachia strain andinsect genotype, as well as interactions with the environment. We employed bothartificial selection and inbreeding with the goal of creating lines of Ae.aegypti with heritable and distinct Wolbachia densities so that we might betterdissect the mechanism underlying PB. We were unable to shift the mean relativeWolbachia density in Ae. aegypti lines by either strategy, with relativedensities instead tending to cycle over a narrow range. In lieu of this, we used Wolbachia densities in mosquito legs as predictors of relative densities in theremaining individual's carcass. Because we worked with outbred mosquitoes, ourfindings indicate either a lack of genetic variation in the mosquito forcontrolling relative density, natural selection against extreme densities, or apredominance of environmental factors affecting densities. Our study reveals thatthere are moderating forces acting on relative Wolbachia densities that may help to stabilize density phenotypes post field release. We also show a means toaccurately bin vector carcasses into high and low categories for non-DNAomics-based studies of Wolbachia-mediated traits.

AB  - Some children with severe microcephaly related to Zika virus infection showaffective social-like behavior, such as smiling and rejection to a stranger'slap. Our objective was to check the association between this behavior and theoccurrence of Mismatch Response (MMR) in event-related potentials. Twenty eightmicrocephalic children, aged 1-3 years, were divided in Affect(+) and Affect(-)groups, according to either the presence or absence of affective social-likebehavior, respectively, and underwent the OddBall paradigm with vowels asauditory stimuli. MMR was statistically estimated comparing MMR sample meansbetween both groups. The Affect(+) group significantly differed from theAffect(-) group and, as opposed to the latter, showed MMR as Mismatch Negativity (MMN) in the left occipital, left and right posterior temporal, and (especially) the right and median parietal leads. The relationship observed between MMN andaffective social-like behavior suggests that these children may have cognitivemechanisms capable of providing some social interaction, despite their profoundneurological dysfunction. MMN diagnostic techniques seem to be promising for the triage of microcephalic subjects regarding cognitive functions and for choosing astrategy for some social adaptation.

AB  - CONTEXT: In 2015, Impactivo developed the Advancing Leadership in Times of Crisis(ALTC) program for the Region 2 Public Health Training Center under a subawardfrom the Health Resources and Services Administration. Puerto Rico's (PR)government had defaulted on its debt, and public health officials needed tools toface the fiscal crisis. The ALTC has since been adapted for PR's public healthemergencies, including the Zika epidemic, category 5 hurricanes, earthquakes, andthe Covid-19 pandemic. PROGRAM: The program incorporates Ron Heifetz's work onAdaptive Leadership and Marshall Ganz's work on community organizing to addressthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Essential Public Health Services(EPHS) and health equity. The ALTC is a contextualized and modularized trainingprogram that has been provided in different modalities in person and online.IMPLEMENTATION: The Spanish language program has been carried out with 4 cohorts (totaling 82 graduates). Participants were 80% women and 100% Hispanic,empowering underrepresented groups to achieve change. EVALUATION: In theimmediate postprogram survey, more than 90% strongly agree that theirunderstanding of the subject matter improved, that they were able to identifyactions that apply to their work, and that they were confident in their abilityto apply it. Follow-up surveys after the COVID-19 pandemic found that 89% ofrespondents continue to work in public health, 25% were promoted, and 49% feltconfident to train others. Participants also reported that ALTC helped themincrease their public health tools (91%), expand their network (84%), andstrengthen knowledge about the EPHS (90%). DISCUSSION: Evidence supports thatALTC is a promising training program to increase leadership skills and EPHScompetencies that can be adapted to address contextual health equity and publichealth emergencies. Future research should explore the expansion of ALTC to othercontexts and its impact on population health and health equity.

TI  - A rapid method for screening mosquito repellents on Anopheles pseudopunctipennis and Aedes aegypti.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07600-w [doi]
AB  - One of the main vectors for malaria in Latin America is Anophelespseudopunctipennis (Theobald), whereas Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vectorof dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya viruses. The use of repellents isrecommended as a personal protection method against these mosquitoes. Howeverthere are very few studies evaluating the effect of repellents on An.pseudopunctipennis. The use of a Petri dish to study repellence has been applied by several authors on flies, cockroaches, kissing bugs and mosquitoes, being avaluable technique for species that are difficult to breed under laboratoryconditions, such as An. pseudopunctipennis. In the present study, we evaluatedthe repellence of the essential oil of the Eucalyptus nitens (Shining gum), itsmain component (1,8-cineole) and the commercial repellent DEET on An.pseudopunctipennis and Ae. aegypti adult females using the plaque repellencymethod coupled to EthoVision XT10.1 video-tracking software. Repellent effect andlocomotor activity were studied through a repellence index (RI) together with an axis constructed from the behavioural variables obtained using the trackingsoftware. DEET repellent effect was observed at 0.01 mg/mL for Ae. aegypti and0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL for An. pseudopunctipennis. In addition, the essential oilshowed significant repellence at 1 and 10 mg/mL for Ae. aegypti, and 1, 5, 10 and25 mg/mL for An. pseudopunctipennis. Neither of these species were repelled atany concentration of 1,8-cineole. This is the first study that evaluates thesecompounds on An. pseudopunctipennis females and quantifies their effects on theactivity of both species.

TI  - Model-Based Projection of Zika Infection Risk with Temperature Effect: A CaseStudy in Southeast Asia.

LID - 10.1007/s11538-022-01049-9 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) recently reemerged in the Americas and rapidly expanded inglobal range. It is posing significant concerns of public health due to its link to birth defects and its complicated transmission routes. Southeast Asia is badlyhit by ZIKV, but limited information was found on the transmission potential ofZIKV in the region. In this paper, we develop a new dynamic process-basedmathematical model, which incorporates the interactions among humans (sexualtransmissibility), and between human and mosquitoes (biting transmissibility), aswell as the essential impacts of temperature. The model is first validated byfitting the 2016 ZIKV outbreak in Singapore via Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Based on that, we demonstrate the effects of temperature on mosquito ecology and ZIKV transmission, and further clarify the potential risk of ZIKV outbreak inSoutheast Asian countries. The results show that (i) the estimated infectionreproduction number [Formula: see text] in Singapore fell from 6.93 (in which thecontribution of sexual transmission was 0.89) to 0.24 after the deployment ofcontrol strategies; (ii) the optimal temperature for the reproduction of ZIKVinfections and adult mosquitoes are estimated to be [Formula: see text]C and[Formula: see text]C, respectively; and (iii) the [Formula: see text] inSoutheast Asia could be between 3 and 7, with an inverted-U shape around theyear. The large values of [Formula: see text] and the simulative patterns of ZIKVtransmission in each country highlights the high risk of ZIKV attack in SoutheastAsia.

PG  - e0049122
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00491-22 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we use electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), anestablished cell-based electrical impedance (CEI) technology, to decipher thekinetic cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by Zika virus (ZIKV) in susceptible humanA549 lung epithelial cells and to evaluate several classes of compounds withreported antiviral activity (two entry inhibitors and two replicationinhibitors). To validate the assay, we compare the results with those obtainedwith more traditional in vitro methods based on cell viability and viral yieldreadouts. We demonstrate that CEI can detect viral infection in a sensitivemanner and can be used to determine antiviral potency. Moreover, CEI has multiplebenefits compared to conventional assays: the technique is less laborious andbetter at visualizing the dynamic antiviral activity profile of the compounds,while also it has the ability to determine interesting time points that can beselected as endpoints in assays without continuous readout. We describe severalparameters to characterize the compounds' cytotoxicity and their antiviralactivity profile. In addition, the CEI patterns provide valuable additionalinformation about the presumed mechanism of action of these compounds. Finally,as a proof of concept, we used CEI to evaluate the antiviral activity of a small series of compounds, for which we demonstrate that the sulfonated polymer PRO2000inhibits ZIKV with a response profile representative for a viral entry inhibitor.Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that CEI is a powerful technology toevaluate and characterize compounds against ZIKV replication in a real-time,label-free, and noninvasive manner. IMPORTANCE Zika virus can cause seriousdisease in humans. Unfortunately, no antiviral drugs are available to treatinfection. Here, we use an impedance-based method to continuously monitor virusinfection in-and damage to-human cells. We can determine the Zika viral dose withthis technique and also evaluate whether antiviral compounds protect the cellsfrom damage caused by virus replication. We also show that this technique can be used to further unravel the characteristics of these compounds, such as theirtoxicity to the cells, and that it might even give further insight in theirmechanism of antiviral action. Finally, we also find a novel Zika virusinhibitor, PRO2000. Overall, in this study, we use the impedance technologyto-for the first time-evaluate compounds with anti-Zika virus properties, andtherefore it can add valuable information in the further search for antiviraldrugs.

TI  - Zika Virus Replication in a Mast Cell Model is Augmented by Dengue VirusAntibody-Dependent Enhancement and Features a Selective Immune Mediator SecretoryProfile.
PG  - e0177222
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01772-22 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus and dengue virus are evolutionarily related and structurally similarmosquito-borne Flaviviruses. These congruencies can lead to cross-reactiveantibody binding, whereby antibodies generated from previous dengue virusimmunity can augment Zika virus replication in vitro. This phenomenon, termedantibody-dependent enhancement, may participate in the clinical manifestationsdetected in areas with Flavivirus cocirculations where Zika virus is endemic;however, a causal relationship has yet to be determined. The KU812 mastcell/basophil line was integral in identifying the first Flavivirus infection in mast cells and serves as an effective in vitro model to study dengue virusantibody-dependent enhancement. Mast cells, sentinel white blood cells intrinsic in coordinating early immune defenses, are characteristically situated in theintradermal space and are therefore among the first immune cells interfaced with blood-feeding mosquitoes. Here, we tested whether KU812 cells were permissive to Zika virus, how previous dengue virus immunity might augment Zika virusinfection, and whether either condition induces an immunological response. Wereport an antibody-dependent enhancement effect of Zika virus infection in KU812 cells across multiple time points (48, 72, and 96 hours postinfection [hpi]) and a range of multiplicities of infection (4.0 x 10(-3) to 4) using variousconcentrations of cross-reactive dengue virus monoclonal antibodies (D11C and1.6D). This antigen-specific antibody-mediated infection was selectively coupled to chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), and C-X-C motifchemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) secretion and a reduction in granzyme B (GrB)release. Therefore, mast cells and/or basophils may significantly augment Zikavirus infection in the context of preexisting dengue virus immunity. IMPORTANCEAntibodies generated against one dengue serotype can enhance infection of anotherby a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally,antigenic similarities between Zika and dengue viruses can promote Zika virusinfection by way of ADE in vitro using these very same anti-dengue antibodies. Weused the KU812 cell line to demonstrate for the first time that anti-dengueantibodies enhanced infectious Zika virus replication in a mast cell model andspecifically increased CCL5, CXCL10, and IL-1beta, while also impairing granzyme B secretion. Furthermore, enhanced Zika virus infection and selective mediatorrelease were mechanistically dependent on fragment crystallizable gamma receptor II (FcgammaRII). These findings establish a new model for Zika virus research anda new subcategory of immune cells previously unexplored in the context of Zikavirus enhancement while being some of the very first immune cells likely to meet a blood-feeding infected mosquito.

TI  - S-Palmitoylation and Sterol Interactions Mediate Antiviral Specificity of IFITMs.
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.2c00176 [doi]
AB  - Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1, 2, and 3) are importantantiviral proteins that are active against many viruses, including influenza Avirus (IAV), dengue virus (DENV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Zika virus (ZIKV), andsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). IFITM proteins exhibit specificity in activity, but their distinct mechanisms of action and regulationare unclear. Since S-palmitoylation and cholesterol homeostasis are crucial forviral infections, we investigated IFITM interactions with cholesterol byphotoaffinity cross-linking in mammalian cells along with molecular dynamicsimulations and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis in vitro. These studiessuggest that cholesterol can directly interact with S-palmitoylated IFITMs incells and alter the conformation of IFITMs in membrane bilayers. Notably, wediscovered that the S-palmitoylation levels regulate differential IFITM proteininteractions with cholesterol in mammalian cells and specificity of antiviralactivity toward IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and EBOV. Our studies suggest that modulation ofIFITM S-palmitoylation levels and cholesterol interaction influence hostsusceptibility to different viruses.

TI  - Comparing sources of mobility for modelling the epidemic spread of Zika virus in Colombia.
PG  - e0010565
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010565 [doi]
AB  - Timely, accurate, and comparative data on human mobility is of paramountimportance for epidemic preparedness and response, but generally not available oreasily accessible. Mobile phone metadata, typically in the form of Call DetailRecords (CDRs), represents a powerful source of information on human movements atan unprecedented scale. In this work, we investigate the potential benefits ofharnessing aggregated CDR-derived mobility to predict the 2015-2016 Zika virus(ZIKV) outbreak in Colombia, when compared to other traditional data sources. To simulate the spread of ZIKV at sub-national level in Colombia, we employ astochastic metapopulation epidemic model for vector-borne diseases. Our modelintegrates detailed data on the key drivers of ZIKV spread, including the spatialheterogeneity of the mosquito abundance, and the exposure of the population tothe virus due to environmental and socio-economic factors. Given the samemodelling settings (i.e. initial conditions and epidemiological parameters), weperform in-silico simulations for each mobility network and assess their ability in reproducing the local outbreak as reported by the official surveillance data. We assess the performance of our epidemic modelling approach in capturing theZIKV outbreak both nationally and sub-nationally. Our model estimates arestrongly correlated with the surveillance data at the country level (Pearson's r = 0.92 for the CDR-informed network). Moreover, we found strong performance ofthe model estimates generated by the CDR-informed mobility networks inreproducing the local outbreak observed at the sub-national level. Compared tothe CDR-informed networks, the performance of the other mobility networks iseither comparatively similar or substantially lower, with no added value inpredicting the local epidemic. This suggests that mobile phone data captures abetter picture of human mobility patterns. This work contributes to the ongoingdiscussion on the value of aggregated mobility estimates from CDRs data that,with appropriate data protection and privacy safeguards, can be used for socialimpact applications and humanitarian action.

TI  - Immunological imbalance in microcephalic children with congenital Zika virussyndrome.
LID - 10.1007/s00430-022-00746-5 [doi]
AB  - Microcephalic children due congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS) presentneurological symptoms already well described. However, several other alterations can also be observed. Here, we aimed to evaluate the immune system ofmicrocephaly CZS children. We showed that these patients have enlarged thymus,spleen and cervical lymph nodes, analysed by ultrasound and compared to thereference values for healthy children. In the periphery, they have an increase ineosinophil count and morphological alterations as hypersegmented neutrophils and atypical lymphocytes, even in the absence of urinary tract infections,parasitological infections or other current symptomatic infections. Microcephalicchildren due CZS also have high levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and type I IFNs, compared to healthy controls. In addition, this population showed adeficient cellular immune memory as demonstrated by the low reactivity to thetuberculin skin test even though they had been vaccinated with BCG less than 2years before the challenge with the PPD. Together, our data demonstrate for thefirst time that CZS can cause alterations in primary and secondary lymphoidorgans and also alters the morphology and functionality of the immune systemcells, which broadens the spectrum of CZS symptoms. This knowledge may assist thedevelopment of specific therapeutic and more efficient vaccination schemes forthis population of patients.

TI  - The microbial RNA metagenome of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) fromGermany.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07576-7 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive mosquito species that has become widespreadacross the globe. In addition, it is an efficient vector of numerous pathogens ofmedical and veterinary importance, including dengue, chikungunya and Zikaviruses. Among others, the vector potential of mosquitoes is influenced by their microbiome. However, this influence is very dynamic and can vary betweenindividuals and life stages. To obtain a rough overview on the microbiome of Ae. albopictus populations in Germany, pooled female and pooled male individuals fromseven German locations were investigated by total RNA sequencing. The mosquitospecimens had been collected as larvae in the field and processed immediatelyafter adult emergence, i.e. without females having fed on blood. RNA fragmentswith high degrees of identity to a large number of viruses and microorganismswere identified, including, for example, Wolbachia pipientis and Acinetobacterbaumannii, with differences between male and female mosquitoes. Knowledge aboutthe natural occurrence of microorganisms in mosquitoes may be translated into newapproaches to vector control, for example W. pipientis can be exploited tomanipulate mosquito reproduction and vector competence. The study results showhow diverse the microbiome of Ae. albopictus can be, and the more so needs to be adequately analysed and interpreted.

TI  - Biocompatible and Selective Generation of Bicyclic Peptides.
LID - 10.1002/anie.202208400 [doi]
AB  - Bicyclic peptides possess superior properties for drug discovery; however, their chemical synthesis is not straightforward and often neither biocompatible norfully orthogonal to all canonical amino acids. The selective reaction between1,2-aminothiols and 2,6-dicyanopyridine allows direct access to complex bicyclic peptides in high yield. The process can be fully automated using standardsolid-phase peptide synthesis. Bicyclization occurs in water at physiological pH within minutes and without the need for a catalyst. The use of various linkersallows tailored bicyclic peptides with qualities such as plasma stability,conformational preorganization, and high target affinity. We demonstrate this fora bicyclic inhibitor of the Zika virus protease NS2B-NS3 as well as for bicyclic versions of the alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide aurein 1.2.

TI  - Vector competence and immune response of Aedes aegypti for Ebinur Lake virus, anewly classified mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus.
PG  - e0010642
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010642 [doi]
AB  - The global impact of mosquito-borne diseases has increased significantly overrecent decades. Ebinur Lake virus (EBIV), a newly classified orthobunyavirus, is reported to be highly pathogenic in adult mice. The evaluation of vectorcompetence is essential for predicting the arbovirus transmission risk. Here,Aedes aegypti was applied to evaluate EBIV infection and dissemination inmosquitos. Our experiments indicated that Ae. aegypti had the possibility tospread EBIV (with a transmission rate of up to 11.8% at 14 days post-infection)through biting, with the highest viral dose in a single mosquito's salivareaching 6.3 plaque-forming units. The highest infection, dissemination and ovaryinfection rates were 70%, 42.9%, and 29.4%, respectively. The high viralinfection rates in Ae. aegypti ovaries imply the possibility of EBIV verticaltransmission. Ae. aegypti was highly susceptible to intrathoracic infection andthe saliva-positive rate reached 90% at 10 days post-infection. Transcriptomicanalysis revealed Toll and Imd signaling pathways were implicated in themosquito's defensive response to EBIV infection. Defensin C and chitinase 10 werecontinuously downregulated in mosquitoes infected via intrathoracic inoculationof EBIV. Comprehensive analysis of the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for EBIV in laboratory has indicated the potential risk of EBIV transmission throughmosquitoes. Moreover, our findings support a complex interplay between EBIV andthe immune system of mosquito, which could affect its vector competence.

AB  - Social science research investigating the social dynamics of Zika and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is essential to inform future services related to Zika andother infectious diseases. We sought to understand lived experiences with Zikaduring pregnancy, birth, and post-partum by conducting in-depth interviews with asample of 31 women infected with Zika during the 2015-16 outbreak who had a childwith CZS in Pernambuco, Brazil. Transcripts were coded using thematic contentanalysis. Many women experienced shock when their children were born with CZSgiven the lack of information they were provided during the antenatal period.Stigma from loved ones and community members was a salient theme as werefinancial difficulties arising from women having to stop working to care fortheir child. While women experienced significant challenges caring for a childwith CZS, they also exhibited resiliency in their ability to move from shock and sorrow to focusing on the needs of their child. While support services weregenerally available, they were often located at a significant distance. Resultsunderscore the need for interventions to improve patient-provider communication, address socio-structural stressors, and support individual and collectiveresilience in women and families affected by Zika in lower resource settings.

AB  - In 1977, the world witnessed both the eradication of smallpox and the beginningof the modern age of genomics. Over the following half-century, 7 epidemicviruses of international concern galvanized virologists across the globe and led to increasingly extensive virus genome sequencing. These sequencing effortsexerted over periods of rapid adaptation of viruses to new hosts, in particular, humans provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning virusevolution. Investment in virus genome sequencing was dramatically increased bythe unprecedented support for phylogenomic analyses during the COVID-19 pandemic.In this review, we attempt to piece together comprehensive molecular histories ofthe adaptation of variola virus, HIV-1 M, SARS, H1N1-SIV, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. Disruption of genes involved in virus-hostinteraction in animal hosts, recombination including genome segment reassortment,and adaptive mutations leading to amino acid replacements in virus proteinsinvolved in host receptor binding and membrane fusion are identified as the keyfactors in the evolution of epidemic viruses.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes significant human diseases without specific therapy.Previously we found erythrosin B, an FDA-approved food additive, inhibited viral NS2B-NS3 interactions, leading to inhibition of ZIKV infection in cell culture.In this study, we performed pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies to demonstratethe efficacy of erythrosin B against ZIKV in 3D mini-brain organoid and mousemodels. Our results showed that erythrosin B is very effective in abolishing ZIKVreplication in the 3D organoid model. Although pharmacokinetics studies indicatedthat erythrosin B had a low absorption profile, mice challenged by a lethal dose of ZIKV showed a significantly improved survival rate upon oral administration oferythrosin B, compared to vehicle control. Limited structure-activityrelationship studies indicated that most analogs of erythrosin B withmodifications on the xanthene ring led to loss or reduction of inhibitoryactivities towards viral NS2B-NS3 interactions, protease activity and antiviralefficacy. In contrast, introducing chlorine substitutions on the isobenzofuranring led to slightly increased activities, suggesting that the isobenzofuran ringis well tolerated for modifications. Cytotoxicity studies indicated that allderivatives are nontoxic to human cells. Overall, our studies demonstratederythrosin B is an effective antiviral against ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Introduction Prenatal exposure to the Zika virus can impair neurodevelopment and cause auditory damage. Objective To analyze the frequency-following response(FFR) and the auditory behavior (with the LittlEars ((R)) questionnaire) ofchildren with and without prenatal exposure to Zika virus infection. Methods Atotal of 30 children participated in the present study, divided into 3 groups: 10children with microcephaly and prenatal exposure to the Zika virus; 10normocephalic children with prenatal exposure to the Zika virus; and 10 children with no evidence of prenatal exposure to the virus. The FFR test was performedwith the /da/ syllable. The LittlEars ((R)) questionnaire was used withparents/guardians. Results For the FFR measurements, there was no differencebetween the groups. The children with exposure to the Zika virus presented afinal score in the questionnaire below what is expected from children with normalhearing. A significant difference was observed for the final, semantic, andexpressive scores between the group with microcephaly and the other groups. Astrong negative correlation was seen between the LittlEars ((R)) questionnairefinal score and the FFR measurements for the group with microcephaly whencompared with the other groups. Conclusion Children exposed to the Zika virus,with and without microcephaly, presented FFR patterns similar to what was seen inchildren with no evidence of virus exposure. However, they showed signs ofimmature auditory behavior, suggesting auditory development delay.

TI  - Zika Virus Induces Sex-Dependent Metabolic Changes in Drosophila melanogaster to Promote Viral Replication.
PG  - 903860
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.903860 [doi]
AB  - Zika is a member of the Flaviviridae virus family that poses some of the mostsignificant global health risks, causing neurologic complications that range fromsensory neuropathy and seizures to congenital Zika syndrome (microcephaly) ininfants born to mothers infected during pregnancy. The recent outbreak of Zikavirus (ZIKV) and its serious health threats calls for the characterization andunderstanding of Zika pathogenesis, as well as host antiviral immune functions.Although ZIKV has been associated with activating the RNA interference (RNAi)immune pathway and altering host metabolism, in-depth studies are still required to uncover the specifics of the complex host-virus interactions and provideadditional insights into the molecular components that determine the outcome ofthis disease. Previous research establishes the fruit fly Drosophila melanogasteras a reliable model for studying viral pathogens, as it shares significantsimilarities with that of vertebrate animal systems. Here, we have developed anin vivo Drosophila model to investigate ZIKV-mediated perturbed metabolism incorrelation to the RNAi central mediator Dicer-2. We report that ZIKV infectionreprograms glucose and glycogen metabolism in Dicer-2 mutants to maintainefficient replication and successful propagation. Flies that exhibit thesemetabolic effects also show reduced food intake, which highlights the complicatedneurological defects associated with ZIKV. We show that ZIKV infectionsignificantly reduces insulin gene expression in Dicer-2 mutants, suggesting aninsulin antiviral role against ZIKV and a direct connection to RNAi immunity.Moreover, we find that the insulin receptor substrate chico is crucial to thesurvival of ZIKV-infected flies. These observations are remarkably more severe inadult female flies compared to males, indicating possible sex differences in the rates of infection and susceptibility to the development of disease. Suchfindings not only demonstrate that metabolic alterations can be potentiallyexploited for developing immune therapeutic strategies but also that preventivemeasures for disease development may require sex-specific approaches. Therefore, further studies are urgently needed to explore the molecular factors that couldbe considered as targets to inhibit ZIKV manipulation of host cell metabolism in females and males.

TI  - Screening of febrile patients with suspected malaria from the Brazilian Amazonfor virus infection.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05514-7 [doi]
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are a significant public health threat,especially in tropical and subtropical regions. More than 150 arboviruses cancause febrile illness following infection in humans. The Brazilian Amazon region has the highest number of arboviruses detected worldwide. In addition toarboviruses, malaria, caused by Plasmodium vivax, is endemic in the Amazon.Patients with malaria and arboviral disease frequently show similar clinicalpresentation and laboratory findings, making the diagnosis of the cause of theinfection challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential forviral infections in patients with suspected malaria but without Plasmodiuminfection in the Brazilian Amazon. We recruited 200 subjects with suspectedmalaria in Manaus, Brazil. First, we tested for arboviruses in serum samples from124 of the 200 participants using an arbovirus DNA microarray platform, which didnot detect any virus. Then, we mixed the serum samples of the other 76participants in 10 pools and subjected them to next-generation sequencing.Analysis of the sequencing data revealed the presence of only one arbovirus (Zikavirus) in one sample pool. This analysis also detected the presence of primateerythroparvovirus 1 and pegivirus C. These results suggest that arboviruses arenot the most frequent viral infections in patients with suspected malaria butwithout Plasmodium infection in the metropolitan region of Manaus. Implementationof specific viral surveillance tests will help in the early detection of viruses with epidemic potential.

PG  - 12137
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16252-w [doi]
AB  - The Musashi (MSI) family of RNA-binding proteins, comprising the two homologsMusashi-1 (MSI1) and Musashi-2 (MSI2), typically regulates translation and isinvolved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. MSI proteins contain tworibonucleoprotein-like RNA-binding domains, RBD1 and RBD2, that bindsingle-stranded RNA motifs with a central UAG trinucleotide with high affinityand specificity. The finding that MSI also promotes the replication of Zikavirus, a neurotropic Flavivirus, has triggered further investigations of thebiochemical principles behind MSI-RNA interactions. However, a detailed molecularunderstanding of the specificity of MSI RBD1/2 interaction with RNA is stillmissing. Here, we performed computational studies of MSI1-RNA associationcomplexes, investigating different RNA pentamer motifs using molecular dynamicssimulations with binding free energy calculations based on the solvatedinteraction energy method. Simulations with Alphafold2 suggest that predicted MSIprotein structures are highly similar to experimentally determined structures.The binding free energies show that two out of four RNA pentamers exhibit aconsiderably higher binding affinity to MSI1 RBD1 and RBD2, respectively. Theobtained structural information on MSI1 RBD1 and RBD2 will be useful for adetailed functional and mechanistic understanding of this type of RNA-proteininteractions.

TI  - The economic burden of congenital Zika Syndrome in Brazil: an overview at 5 yearsand 10 years.
LID - e008784 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-008784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to estimate the economic burden of children with congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) in Brazil over 5-10 years. METHODS: Weconducted a modelling study based on data collected in a case-control study inBrazil, including children with CZS (cases) and typically developing children(controls), born in 2015 and 2016. In total, 484 participants were recruited intwo sites, Recife and Rio de Janeiro. Social and economic information wascollected in a survey from the carers of cases and controls, and detailedhealthcare utilisation was recorded for each child in the Rio de Janeiro cohortprospectively in a database. We used this information to estimate the cost perchild with severe, moderate and no CZS and incremental cost per child with severeand moderate versus no CZS from a disaggregated societal perspective. Theseestimates were incorporated into an economic burden model to estimate theincremental burden of the CZS epidemic in Brazil over 5 years and 10 years.FINDINGS: The societal cost per child with severe CZS was US$50 523 to 10 yearsof age (born in 2015 and 2016), substantially higher than the costs for moderate CZS (US$29 283) and without CZS (US$12 331). The incremental economic burden ofsevere versus no CZS in Brazil over 10 years was US$69.4 million from thehousehold and US$129.0 million from the government perspective. For moderate CZS,these figures amounted to US$204.1 million and US$86.6 million. Over 10 years,97% of the total societal economic cost of severe CZS is borne by the government,but only 46% for moderate CZS. INTERPRETATION: The economic burden of CZS is highat the household, provider and government levels. The compensatory governmentpayments helped to alleviate some of the additional costs incurred by familieswith a child qualifying for the disability benefits, and could be scaled toinclude the children with moderate CZS.

TI  - FIRST REPORT OF AEDES VITTATUS IN ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN.
LID - 10.2987/22-7067 [doi]
AB  - Aedes vittatus is distributed throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe and cantransmit dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. Like other Aedesspecies, larvae develop in both natural and artificial containers in urban,suburban, and rural areas. In September 2021, an entomological survey wasconducted at the National Institute of Health of Pakistan (NIH) and adjacenthousing within the NIH colony. All containers with water were examined for Aedes mosquitoes at 150 locations, including residential properties, a plant nursery,junkyards, and recreational parks and playgrounds. A total of 103 larvae, 37pupae, 5 female and 2 male Ae. vittatus were collected from a fountain. This was the first detection of Ae. vittatus in urban Islamabad. Additional vectorsurveillance is needed to better understand the geographical distribution,ecology, and behavior of this invasive species and to understand its possiblerole in the transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses in Pakistan.

PG  - 911175
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.911175 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in association with arboviruses, suchas Zika, chikungunya, and dengue, has been previously documented; however,Miller-Fisher Syndrome (MFS) and other GBS subtypes are rarely reported. Methods:We identified a series of GBS and MFS cases that were followed during the Zikavirus outbreak in Salvador, Brazil (2015-2016). Blood and CSF samples werecollected for virus diagnosis. In addition, serological studies to verifyprevious arboviral infection and electromyography (EMG) were performed. Results: Of the 14 patients enrolled, 10 were diagnosed with GBS, including three GBSsubtypes (two cases of bifacial weakness with paresthesia and one case ofparaparetic GBS), and four as MFS. IgM antibodies against one or more of threearboviruses were present in 11 (78.6%) patients: anti-zika IgM positivity ineight (57%), anti-Chikungunya IgM in three (21%), and anti-Dengue in one (7%)individual. A single case was positive for both anti-Dengue IgM andanti-Chikungunya IgM, suggesting co-infection. EMG revealed an AIDP pattern inall nine patients analyzed. Conclusion: The current case series contributes toour knowledge on the clinical presentation of arbovirus-associated GBS and itssubtypes, including MFS, and serves as an alert to clinicians and otherhealthcare professionals in regions affected by arbovirus outbreaks. We highlightthe importance of recognizing arboviruses in diagnosing GBS and its subtypes.

TI  - Condom use among women of reproductive age (18-49 years) in Puerto Rico duringthe 2016 Zika virus outbreak: secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional, population-based, cell-phone survey.
PG  - e065592
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065592 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Zika virus (ZIKV) can be sexually transmitted, and ZIKV infectionduring pregnancy can cause birth defects. Contraception is a medicalcountermeasure to reduce unintended pregnancy and ZIKV-associated birth defects. We estimated the prevalence of condom use and associated factors among women atrisk for unintended pregnancy in Puerto Rico during the 2016 ZIKV outbreak.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, population-based, cell-phonesurvey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Women, 18-49 years, living in Puerto Ricoduring July-November 2016. We limited our analytical sample (n=1840) to women at risk for unintended pregnancy, defined as those who were sexually active with aman in the last 3 months and did not report menopause, hysterectomy, currentpregnancy or desiring pregnancy. OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated the weightedprevalence of any condom use among women at risk for unintended pregnancy. Wecalculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to examine the associationbetween condom use and ZIKV-related factors, stratified by use of more effective versus less effective or no contraception. RESULTS: Overall, 32.7% (95% CI: 30.2%to 35.1%) of women reported any condom use in the last 3 months. Among womenusing more effective contraception, condom use was higher for women who received ZIKV counselling (aPR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.25) and those worried about havinga child with a ZIKV-associated birth defect (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.10).Among women using less effective or no contraception, condom use was associatedwith being worried (aPR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.43) compared with those notworried about ZIKV infection or with a previous known infection. CONCLUSIONS:During the 2016 ZIKV outbreak, one in three women at risk for unintendedpregnancy reported any condom use. Counselling to promote consistent and correct condom use may address concerns regarding ZIKV among women of reproductive age,which may differ by use of effective contraception.

AB  - There are currently no approved drugs to treat Zika virus (ZIKV) infection duringpregnancy. Hyperimmune globulin products such as VARIZIG and WinRho areFDA-approved to treat conditions during pregnancy such as Varicella Zoster virus infection and Rh-incompatibility. We administered ZIKV-specific human immuneglobulin as a treatment in pregnant rhesus macaques one day after subcutaneousZIKV infection. All animals controlled ZIKV viremia following the treatment andgenerated robust levels of anti-Zika virus antibodies in their blood. No adverse fetal or infant outcomes were identified in the treated animals, yet the placebo control treated animals also did not have signs related to congenital Zikasyndrome (CZS). Human immune globulin may be a viable prophylaxis and treatmentoption for ZIKV infection during pregnancy, however, more studies are required tofully assess the impact of this treatment to prevent CZS.

AB  - The global spread of the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and itscomplications including Guillain-Barre syndrome and fetus microcephaly in 2015have made ZIKV as a significant public health threat. The capsid protein playscrucial roles in ZIKV replication and thus represents an attractive therapeutictarget. However, inhibitors of ZIKV capsid assembly have not been rigorouslyidentified due to the lack of a target-based screening system. In this study, we developed a novel ZIKV capsid interaction method based on a split-luciferasecomplementation assay, which can be used to measure and quantify ZIKVcapsid-capsid (C-C) interaction by the restored luciferase signal when capsidproteins interact with each other. Furthermore, a Tet-on inducible stable cellline was generated to screen inhibitors of capsid dimerization. By using of this system, peptides (Pep.15-24 in the N-terminal region of ZIKV capsid protein andPep.44-58 in the alpha2 helix of ZIKV capsid protein) were identified to inhibit ZIKV C-C interaction. Overall, this study developed a novel inducible assaysystem to measure ZIKV capsid interaction and identify ZIKV capsidmultimerization inhibitors, which will be applied for future discovery of ZIKVassembly inhibitors.

AB  - Zika virus is an RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus family that is chieflytransmitted by the female Aedes mosquito. The Zika virus first infected humans inUganda and Tanzania in 1952. Since, it has spread to several parts of the worldcausing outbreaks of variable extent. In India, these outbreaks have beenreported from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Kerala, andMaharashtra. The most recent outbreak is from the most populous state of India,Uttar Pradesh, where the climate is conducive to the breeding and transmission ofother arboviral infections such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Malaria. Theseinfections also happen to share similar incubation periods and overlappingclinical manifestations with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, leading to misdiagnosesor delayed diagnosis. We aim to provide an account of the outbreak, itsrepercussions, errors made in attempting to contain the spread of the disease,and, measures to be taken in the future.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.), the yellow fever mosquito, is also an important vector ofdengue and Zika viruses, and an invasive species in North America. Aedes aegypti inhabits tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world and in North America isprimarily distributed throughout the southern US states and Mexico. The northern range of Ae. aegypti is limited by cold winter months and establishment in these areas has been mostly unsuccessful. However, frequent introductions of Ae.aegypti to temperate, non-endemic areas during the warmer months can lead toseasonal activity and disease outbreaks. Two Ae. aegypti incursions were reportedin the late summer of 2019 into York, Nebraska and Moab, Utah. These states hadno history of established populations of this mosquito and no evidence ofprevious seasonal activity. We genotyped a subset of individuals from eachlocation at 12 microsatellite loci and ~ 14,000 single nucleotide polymorphicmarkers to determine their genetic affinities to other populations worldwide and investigate their potential source of introduction. Our results support a single origin for each of the introductions from different sources. Aedes aegypti fromUtah likely derived from Tucson, Arizona, or a nearby location. Nebraska specimenresults were not as conclusive, but point to an origin from southcentral orsoutheastern US. In addition to an effective, efficient, and sustainable control of invasive mosquitoes, such as Ae. aegypti, identifying the potential routes of introduction will be key to prevent future incursions and assess their potential health threat based on the ability of the source population to transmit aparticular virus and its insecticide resistance profile, which may complicatevector control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aedes-borne viruses (ABV) affect humans on every inhabited continentand frequently cause epidemics. Recent epidemics of chikungunya and Zika viruses highlight that preparedness for future epidemics requires assessment ofsusceptibility, particularly among high-risk groups. We sought to determineimmunity against the three major circulating ABV among pregnant women in anABV-endemic area of Colombia. METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study wasperformed, enrolling women presenting to Labor and Delivery. Cord blood andmaternal peripheral blood was obtained. IgG seroprevalence to flaviviruses andchikungunya was determined by ELISA. An abbreviated neutralization test was used to estimate the frequency and magnitude of immunity to Zika and four dengueserotypes. Cluster analyses explored epidemiologic factors associated withseroprevalence. RESULTS: Most women exhibited high levels of neutralizingantibodies to one or more ABV; however, nearly 20% were seronegative forflaviviruses. Our research took place after the epidemic peak of the ZIKVoutbreak in Colombia in 2016, but only 20% of pregnant women had high levels ofZika-neutralizing antibodies consistent with likely protective immunity to ZIKV. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, a high proportion pregnant women in Risaralda remainsusceptible to one or more ABV including the teratogenic ZIKV, indicating riskfor future epidemics in this region.

AB  - Researchers are constantly looking to find new techniques of virus detection thatare sensitive, cost-effective, and accurate. Additionally, they can be used as a point-of-care (POC) tool due to the fact that the populace is growing at a quick tempo, and epidemics are materializing greater often than ever.Electrochemiluminescence-based (ECL) biosensors for the detection of viruses havebecome one of the most quickly developing sensors in this field. Thus, we herefocus on recent trends and developments of these sensors with regard to virusdetection. Also, quantitative analysis of various viruses (e.g., Influenza virus,SARS-CoV-2, HIV, HPV, Hepatitis virus, and Zika virus) with a specific interestin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was introducedfrom the perspective of the biomarker and the biological receptor immobilized on the ECL-based sensors, such as nucleic acids-based, immunosensors, and otheraffinity ECL biosensors.

AB  - Bacteria, viruses, and parasites are harmful microorganisms that cause infectiousdiseases. Early detection of diseases is critical to prevent disease transmissionand provide epidemic preparedness, as these can cause widespread deaths andpublic health crises, particularly in resource-limited countries. Lateral flowassay (LFA) systems are simple-to-use, disposable, inexpensive diagnostic devicesto test biomarkers in blood and urine samples. Thus, LFA has recently receivedsignificant attention, especially during the pandemic. Here, first of all, thedesign principles and working mechanisms of existing LFA methods are examined.Then, current LFA implementation strategies are presented for communicabledisease diagnoses, including COVID-19, zika and dengue, HIV, hepatitis,influenza, malaria, and other pathogens. Furthermore, this review focuses on anoverview of current problems and accessible solutions in detecting infectiousagents and diseases by LFA, focusing on increasing sensitivity with variousdetection methods. In addition, future trends in LFA-based diagnostics areenvisioned.

TI  - Dengue Virus-2 Infection Affects Fecundity and Elicits Specific TranscriptionalChanges in the Ovaries of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes.
PG  - 886787
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.886787 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever (DF), caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is the most burdensomearboviral disease in the world, with an estimated 400 million infections eachyear. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main vector of DENV and transmits severalother human pathogens, including Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses.Previous studies have shown that the pathogen infection of mosquitoes can alterreproductive fitness, revealing specific vector-pathogen interactions that arekey determinants of vector competence. However, only a handful of studies haveexamined the effect of DENV infection in A. aegypti, showing a reduction inlifespan and fecundity over multiple blood meals. To provide a more comprehensiveanalysis of the impact of DENV infection on egg laying and fecundity, we assessedegg laying timing in DENV-2 blood-fed mosquitoes (infected group) compared tomock blood-fed mosquitoes (control group). We confirmed a significant decrease infecundity during the first gonadotrophic cycle. To further investigate thisphenotype and the underlying DENV-2 infection-dependent changes in geneexpression, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis for differentially expressedgenes in the ovaries of A. aegypti infected with DENV-2 vs. mock-infectedmosquitoes. This analysis reveals several DENV-2-regulated genes; among them, we identified a group of 12 metabolic genes that we validated using reversetranscription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Interestingly, two genes found to beupregulated in DENV-infected mosquito ovaries exhibited an antiviral role forDENV-2 in an Aedes cell line. Altogether, this study offers useful insights into the virus-vector interface, highlighting the importance of gene expressionchanges in the mosquito's ovary during DENV-2 infection in the firstgonadotrophic cycle, triggering antiviral responses that may possibly interferewith mosquito reproduction. This information is extremely relevant for furtherinvestigation of A. aegypti's ability to tolerate viruses since virally infected mosquitoes in nature constitute a powerful source of supporting viruses duringintra-epidemic periods, causing a huge burden on the public health system.

PG  - 100128
LID - 10.1016/j.xjidi.2022.100128 [doi]
AB  - Arboviruses such as flaviviruses and alphaviruses cause a significant humanhealthcare burden on a global scale. Transmission of these viruses occurs during human blood feeding at the mosquito-skin interface. Not only do pathogen immuneevasion strategies influence the initial infection and replication of pathogensdelivered, but arthropod salivary factors also influence transmission foci. Invitro cell cultures do not provide an adequate environment to study complexinteractions between viral, mosquito, and host factors. To address this need for a whole tissue system, we describe a proof of concept model for arbovirusinfection using adult human skin ex vivo with Zika virus (flavivirus) and Mayaro virus (alphavirus). Replication of these viruses in human skin was observed up to4 days after infection. Egressed viruses could be detected in the culture mediaas well. Antiviral and proinflammatory genes, including chemoattractantchemokines, were expressed in infected tissue. Immunohistochemical analysisshowed the presence of virus in the skin tissue 4 days after infection. Thismodel will be useful to further investigate: (i) the immediate molecularmechanisms of arbovirus infection in human skin, and (ii) the influence ofarthropod salivary molecules during initial infection of arboviruses in a morephysiologically relevant system.

LID - 10.1099/acmi.0.000340 [doi]
AB  - We report the molecular evidence of dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus(CHIKV) infection in symptomatic individuals in Cameroon and Gabon, respectively.Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are distributed in the tropical orsubtropical regions, with DENV having the highest burden. The morbidity andmortality related to arboviral diseases raise the concern of timely and efficientsurveillance and care. Our aim was to assess the circulation of arboviruses[DENV, CHIKV, Zika virus (ZIKV)] among febrile patients in Dschang (WestCameroon) and Kye-ossi (South Cameroon, border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea).Dried blood spots were collected from 601 consenting febrile patients, and 194Plasmodium spp.-negative samples were tested for the molecular detection of casesof DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV infection. Overall, no case of ZIKV infection was found, whereas one case of DENV infection and one case of CHIKV infection were detected in Dschang and Kye-ossi, respectively, with the CHIKV-infected patient beingresident in Gabon. Our findings suggest the need to establish an activesurveillance of arbovirus transmission in Cameroon and bordering countries.

AB  - In November 2015, cases of Zika virus infection were recorded in Cabo Verde(Africa), originating from Brazil. The outbreak subsided after seven months with 7580 suspected cases. We performed a serological survey (n = 431) in Praia, thecapital city, 3 months after transmission ceased. Serum samples were screened forarbovirus antibodies using ELISA techniques and revealed seroconvertedindividuals with Zika (10.9%), dengue (1-4) (12.5%), yellow fever (0.2%) andchikungunya (2.6%) infections. Zika seropositivity was predominantly observedamongst females (70%). Using a logistic model, risk factors for increased odds ofZika seropositivity included age, self-reported Zika infection, and dengueseropositivity. Serological data from Zika and dengue virus assays were strongly correlated (Spearman's rs = 0.80), which reduced when using a double antigenbinding ELISA (Spearman's rs = 0.54). Overall, our work improves an understandingof how Zika and other arboviruses have spread throughout the Cabo Verdepopulation. It also demonstrates the utility of serological assay formats foroutbreak investigations.

AB  - Flaviviruses, such as Dengue and Zika viruses, infect millions of peopleworldwide using mosquitos as vectors. In this issue of Cell, Zhang et al. reveal how these viruses manipulate the skin microbiome of infected hosts in a way that increases vector recruitment and viral spread. They propose vitamin A as a way tocounteract the virus and decrease transmission.

AB  - Objective: In 2019, dengue was among the "top-ten threats to global health," with3.1 million cases reported from the Americas, the highest ever. Simultaneously,Jamaica reported its largest dengue outbreak in 40 years, following Chikungunyaand Zika virus epidemics, in 2014 and 2016-2017, respectively. We describe denguein children admitted to five hospitals in Jamaica during August 2018 throughSeptember 2019. Methods: Hospitalized children and adolescents aged 0 to 15 yearswith dengue were managed using PAHO/WHO criteria. Data were extracted fromquestionnaires, entered into a dataset on Microsoft Excel version 2016, exported to SPSS version 20 and analyzed. Groups were compared using Student's t-test for normally distributed parametric data. Chi-square analysis, or Fisher's exact testwas used for categorical variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant. Results: There were 339 children, 245 (72.3%) aged 1-10 years,males:females 1:1. Classification was "dengue without warning signs" 53 (15.3%), "dengue with warning signs" 218 (64.3%) and "severe dengue" 68 (20%).Co-morbidities were reported in 88 (26%). Hemoglobin SC disease was associatedwith severe dengue with hemorrhage (p = 0.005). Organ-system involvement occurredin 334 (98.5%) including gastrointestinal 317 (93.5%), hematologic 311 (91.7%)and musculoskeletal 180 (53.1%). Thirty-nine (11.5%) had 5-7 organ-systemsinvolved. Metabolomics emphasized increased hepatic transaminases 245 (72.3%),lactate dehydrogenase 164 (48.4%) and creatine phosphokinase 84 (24.8%)approaching the high thousands (121,560 u/L), both were markers for severedisease (p < 0.002). Thirteen (3.8%) received intensive care. Dengue waslaboratory-confirmed in 220 (78.9%): NS1 antigen-positive (218); RT-PCR-positive (23), with an overlap of NS1 antigen and RT-PCR positive (21); DENV-3 serotype(20). Seventeen (5%) died, 16 (94.1%) had severe dengue and 11 (64.7%) succumbed within 24 to 48 h of admission despite resuscitation and transfusion of bloodproducts. Conclusion: Severe dengue with increased attributable mortalityoccurred in hospitalized children after Jamaica's maiden Zika epidemic.

AB  - Dengue and Zika viruses cocirculate annually in endemic areas of Mexico, causing outbreaks of different magnitude and severity every year, suggesting a continuousselection of Flavivirus variants with variable phenotypes of transmissibility andvirulence. To evaluate if Flavivirus variants with different phenotypescocirculate during outbreaks, we isolated dengue and Zika viruses from bloodsamples of febrile patients from Oaxaca City during the 2016 and 2019 epidemicyears. We compared their replication kinetics in human cells, susceptibility totype I interferon antiviral response, and the accumulation of subgenomic RNA oninfected cells. We observed correlations between type I interferon susceptibilityand subgenomic RNA accumulation, with high hematocrit percentage andthrombocytopenia. Our results suggest that Flaviviruses that cocirculate inOaxaca, Mexico, have variable sensitivity to the antiviral activity of type Iinterferons, and this phenotypic trait correlates with the severity of thedisease.

AB  - CRISPR-mediated genome engineering technologies have been adapted to a widevariety of organisms with high efficiency and specificity. The yellow fevermosquito, Aedes aegypti , is one such organism. It is also responsible fortransmitting a wide variety of deadly viruses including Dengue, Zika, Yellowfever, and Chikungunya. The key to successful CRISPR-mediated gene editingapplications is the delivery of both Cas9 ribonuclease and single-guide RNA(sgRNA ) to the nucleus of desired cells. Various methods have been developed forsupplying the Cas9 endonuclease, sgRNA , and donor DNA to Ae. aegypti. In thischapter, we focus on methods of direct embryo delivery of editing components,presenting detailed step-by-step CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing protocols forinducing desired heritable edits in mosquitoes as well as insights intosuccessful application of these protocols. We also highlight potentialopportunities for customizing these protocols to manipulate the mosquito genomefor innovative in vivo gene function studies.

TI  - Zika virus-like particle vaccine fusion loop mutation increases production yield but fails to protect AG129 mice against Zika virus challenge.
PG  - e0010588
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010588 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with maternal infectionassociated with preterm birth, congenital malformations, and fetal death, andadult infection associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Recent widespreadendemic transmission of ZIKV and the potential for future outbreaks necessitatethe development of an effective vaccine. We developed a ZIKV vaccine candidatebased on virus-like-particles (VLPs) generated following transfection ofmammalian HEK293T cells using a plasmid encoding the pre-membrane/membrane(prM/M) and envelope (E) structural protein genes. VLPs were collected from cell culture supernatant and purified by column chromatography with yields ofapproximately 1-2mg/L. To promote increased particle yields, a single amino acid change of phenylalanine to alanine was made in the E fusion loop at position 108 (F108A) of the lead VLP vaccine candidate. This mutation resulted in a modest2-fold increase in F108A VLP production with no detectable prM processing byfurin to a mature particle, in contrast to the lead candidate (parent). Toevaluate immunogenicity and efficacy, AG129 mice were immunized with a dosetitration of either the immature F108A or lead VLP (each alum adjuvanted). Theresulting VLP-specific binding antibody (Ab) levels were comparable. However,geometric mean neutralizing Ab (nAb) titers using a recombinant ZIKV reporterwere significantly lower with F108A immunization compared to lead. After viruschallenge, all lead VLP-immunized groups showed a significant 3- to 4-Log10reduction in mean ZIKV RNAemia levels compared with control mice immunized onlywith alum, but the RNAemia reduction of 0.5 Log10 for F108A groups wasstatistically similar to the control. Successful viral control by the lead VLPcandidate following challenge supports further vaccine development for thiscandidate. Notably, nAb titer levels in the lead, but not F108A, VLP-immunizedmice inversely correlated with RNAemia. Further evaluation of sera by an in vitroAb-dependent enhancement assay demonstrated that the F108A VLP-induced immunesera had a significantly higher capacity to promote ZIKV infection inFcgammaR-expressing cells. These data indicate that a single amino acid change inthe fusion loop resulted in increased VLP yields but that the immature F108Aparticles were significantly diminished in their capacity to induce nAbs andprovide protection against ZIKV challenge.

TI  - Zika virus alters centrosome organization to suppress the innate immune response.

LID - 10.15252/embr.202052211 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted via mosquitoes and sex to causecongenital neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly. Inherited forms ofmicrocephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization.Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKVinfection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, aMCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, andexpression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization,indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKVinfection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability ofTANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKVinfection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactorDTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKVdisrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization anddestabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.

TI  - CDK4/6 inhibition enhances oncolytic virus efficacy by potentiatingtumor-selective cell killing and T cell activation in refractory glioblastoma.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most aggressive human cancers.Although oncolytic virus (OV) therapy has been proposed as a potential approachto treat GBM, it frequently fails because GBM cells are usually nonpermissive to OV. Here, we describe a dual-step drug screen for identifying chemical enhancers of oncolytic virus in GBM. From a high-throughput screen of 1416 FDA-approveddrugs, an inhibitor of CDK4/6 was identified as the top enhancer, selectivelyincreasing potency of two OV strains, VSVDelta51 and Zika virus. Mechanistically,CDK4/6 inhibition promoted autophagic degradation of MAVS, resulting in impaired antiviral responses and enhanced tumor-selective replication of VSVDelta51 invitro and in vivo. CDK4/6 inhibition cooperated with VSVDelta51 to induce severe DNA damage stress and amplify oncolysis. In GBM xenograft models, combinedtreatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor and VSVDelta51 significantly inhibited tumorgrowth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Further investigationrevealed that CDK4/6 inhibitor and VSVDelta51 synergistically induced immunogeniccell death and boosted anti-tumor immunity. Together, this study features apromising approach of treating aggressive GBM through the combination of CDK4/6inhibitor with OV.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the main vectors ofarboviruses, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. It almost exclusivelyinhabits urban areas. Both sexes feed on plant carbohydrates, although for males,this is their only food source. In the case of floral nectars, mosquitoes locate plant sugar sources assisted by volatile compounds. In this work, we found thatthe floral scent of Senecio madagascariensis elicited a behavioral response inmales; therefore, we focused on identifying the volatiles emitted by theseflowers. The terpenes (+/-)-alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, sabinene, and phellandreneand 1-alkenes 1-undecene, and 1-nonene were identified. To determine whichcompounds are bioactive, pure synthetic lures were assessed using anolfactometer. Only the main compound 1-nonene was an attractant for males. Since our goal was the introduction of synthetic floral-based attractants in toxicsugar-baited traps, we formulated 1-nonene in solid paraffin and stearin matricesto obtain a controlled release system. The bioassay with a toxicological endpoint showed that the incorporation of a feeding attractant to the toxic sugartrap increased overall mortality. These results suggest that it is possible touse plant volatile compounds or flower cuttings as male Ae. aegypti attractantsto improve the efficacy of baited traps.

AB  - Long-read sequencing (LRS) approaches shed new light on the complexity of viral(Kakuk et al., 2021 [1]; Boldogkoi et al., 2019 [2]; Depledge et a., 2019 [3]),bacterial (Yan et al., 2018 [4]) and eukaryotic (Tilgner et al., 2014 [5])transcriptomes. Emerging RNA viruses are zoonotic (Woolhouse et al., 2016 [6])and create public health problems, e.g. influenza pandemic caused by H1N1 virusin (Fraser et al., 2009 [7]), as well as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Kim et al., 2020 [8]). In this study, we carried out nanopore sequencing for generating transcriptomic data valuable for structural and kinetic profiling of siximportant human pathogen RNA viruses, the H1N1 subtype of Influenza A virus(IVA), the Zika virus (ZIKV), the West Nile virus (WNV), the Crimean-Congohemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the Coxsackievirus [group B serotype 5 (CVB5)]and the Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV), and the response of host cellsupon viral infection. The raw sequencing data were filtered during basecallingand only high quality reads (Qscore >/= 7) were mapped to the appropriate viraland host genomes. Length distribution of sequencing reads were assessed andstatistics of data were plotted by the ReadStat.4 python script. The datasets canbe used to profile the transcriptomic landscape of RNA viruses, provideinformation for novel gene annotations, can serve as resource for studying thevirus-host interactions, and for the analysis of RNA base modifications. Thesedatasets can be used to compare the different sequencing techniques, librarypreparation approaches, bioinformatics pipelines, and to analyze the RNA profilesof viruses with small RNA genomes.

TI  - Zika virus persistence in the male macaque reproductive tract.
PG  - e0010566
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010566 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is unique among mosquito-borne flaviviruses in that it is also vertically and sexually transmitted by humans. The male reproductive tract isthought to be a ZIKV reservoir; however, the reported magnitude and duration ofviral persistence in male genital tissues vary widely in humans and non-humanprimate models. ZIKV tissue and cellular tropism and potential effects on malefertility also remain unclear. The objective of this study was to resolve thesequestions by analyzing archived genital tissues from 51 ZIKV-inoculated malemacaques and correlating data on plasma viral kinetics, tissue tropism, andZIKV-induced pathological changes in the reproductive tract. We hypothesized thatZIKV would persist in the male macaque genital tract for longer than there wasdetectable viremia, where it would localize to germ and epithelial cells andassociate with lesions. We detected ZIKV RNA and infectious virus in testis,epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate gland. In contrast to prepubertalmales, sexually mature macaques were significantly more likely to harborpersistent ZIKV RNA or infectious virus somewhere in the genital tract, withdetection as late as 60 days post-inoculation. ZIKV RNA localized primarily totesticular stem cells/sperm precursors and epithelial cells, including Sertolicells, epididymal duct epithelium, and glandular epithelia of the seminal vesicleand prostate gland. ZIKV infection was associated with microscopic evidence ofinflammation in the epididymis and prostate gland of sexually mature males,pathologies that were absent in uninfected controls, which could have significanteffects on male fertility. The findings from this study increase ourunderstanding of persistent ZIKV infection which can inform risk of sexualtransmission during assisted reproductive therapies as well as potential impacts on male fertility.

AB  - Despite the detrimental effects associated with Zika infection, there are noapproved treatments or vaccines available. To address the need for a safe andeffective vaccine for Zika, we formulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)polymeric vaccine microparticles (MP) encapsulating the inactivated Zika virus,along with adjuvant MP encapsulating Alhydrogel(R) and MPL-A(R). We characterizedthe vaccine MP for size, surface charge, morphology, encapsulation efficiency,and antigen integrity. Further, we evaluated immunogenicity and cytotoxicity ofvaccine MP in vitro in murine dendritic cells. Vaccine MP with adjuvants induced significantly higher production of nitric oxide, a marker of innate immunity,when compared to the untreated cells. In addition, vaccine MP with or withoutadjuvants induced increased autophagy in murine dendritic cells when compared to inactivated Zika virus, which is critical in antigen presentation. Next, weevaluated in vivo efficacy of vaccine MP with and without adjuvants in apreclinical murine model by measuring the immune response after intramuscularadministration. Vaccine MP with adjuvants induced significant IgG, Ig2a, and IgG1titers as compared to the control group of untreated mice. Thus, this studyprovided the 'proof-of-concept' for a microparticulate Zika vaccine.

TI  - Larvicidal Activity of Two Rutaceae Plant Essential Oils and Their ConstituentsAgainst Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Multiple Formulations.
LID - tjac083 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac083 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is a vector of several arboviruses, such as dengue,chikungunya, West Nile, and Zika viruses. At present, the use of syntheticinsecticides is the main vector control strategy. However, the widespread andlong-term use of insecticides has aroused several problems, including insecticideresistance, environmental pollution, and non-target species effects, therebyencouraging researchers to search for new alternatives derived from naturalproducts. In recent decades, essential oils (EOs) as natural alternatives tocontrol mosquitoes have received increasing attention. In the initial larvicidal activity screen, two Rutaceae plants (Citrus aurantium and Citrus paradisi) EOswere selected and evaluated for killing Ae. albopictus larvae. The LC50 values ofC. aurantium and C. paradisi EOs against Ae. albopictus were 91.7 and 100.9 ppm, respectively. The main components of C. aurantium EO include diethyl o-phthalate (37.32%), limonene (10.04%), and methyl dihydrojasmonate (6.48%). The maincomponents of C. paradisi EO include limonene (60.51%), diethyl o-phthalate(11.75%), linalool (7.90%), and styralyl acetate (6.28%). Among these maincomponents of the two EOs, limonene showed potent larvicidal activity, with theLC50 value of 39.7 ppm. The nanoemulsions of limonene were prepared andcharacterized. The duration of larvicidal activity was greater in the limonenenanoemulsions than when limonene was applied in solvent. This study demonstrates that EOs of plants in family Rutaceae are a potential resource to develop newlarvicides, and nanoemulsification is an effective method for improving thephysicochemical properties and efficacy of natural products as larvicides.

PG  - 21359-21369
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c05758 [doi]
AB  - Improved techniques were applied to formulate drugs into dimensionalnanostructures, doped "nanovesicles". These nanovesicles are solely composed ofself-assembled amphiphilic antiviral agents used for the treatment of viralinfections caused by flaviviruses, such as Zika virus. Studies were done toevaluate the effectiveness of the syntheses, formation, and performance underdifferent experimental conditions, and behavior of the drug nanovesicles in vitroand in vivo. These studies demonstrated that assembling the hydrophobic antiviraldrug molecules into nanodrugs is a successful technique for the delivery of thetherapeutic agents, otherwise difficult to be supplied. Our studies confirmedthat this nanodrug preserved and, in many cases, enhanced the embedded cellularactivity of the parental free drug molecules, both in vitro and in vivo. Thisproposed formulation is highly important as it addresses the issue ofinsolubility and low bioavailabiity of a wide range of highly potentpharmaceutical drugs-not limited to a specific class of antiviral drugs-that are of high demand for the treatment of medical conditions and emerging pathogens.

TI  - Human Testicular Germ Cells, a Reservoir for Zika Virus, Lack Antiviral Response Upon Zika or Poly(I:C) Exposure.
PG  - 909341
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.909341 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging teratogenic arbovirus that persists in semen andis sexually transmitted. We previously demonstrated that ZIKV infects the humantestis and persists in testicular germ cells (TGCs) for several months afterpatients' recovery. To decipher the mechanisms underlying prolonged ZIKVreplication in TGCs, we compared the innate immune response of human testisexplants and isolated TGCs to ZIKV and to Poly(I:C), a viral RNA analog. Ourresults demonstrate the weak innate responses of human testis to both ZIKV andPoly(I:C) as compared with other tissues or species. TGCs failed to up-regulateantiviral effectors and type I IFN upon ZIKV or Poly(I:C) stimulation, whichmight be due to a tight control of PRR signaling, as evidenced by the absence of activation of the downstream effector IRF3 and elevated expression of repressors.Importantly, exogenous IFNbeta boosted the innate immunity of TGCs and inhibited ZIKV replication in the testis ex vivo, raising hopes for the prevention of ZIKV infection and persistence in this organ.

TI  - Mucosal Vaccination: A Promising Alternative Against Flaviviruses.
PG  - 887729
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.887729 [doi]
AB  - The Flaviviridae are a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA envelopedviruses, and their members belong to a single genus, Flavivirus. Flaviviruses arefound in mosquitoes and ticks; they are etiological agents of: dengue fever,Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus infection, Zika virus infection,tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever, among others. Only a few flavivirusvaccines have been licensed for use in humans: yellow fever, dengue fever,Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and Kyasanur forest disease.However, improvement is necessary in vaccination strategies and in understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved either in the infection or aftervaccination. This is especially important in dengue, due to the immunologicalcomplexity of its four serotypes, cross-reactive responses, antibody-dependentenhancement, and immunological interference. In this context, mucosal vaccinesrepresent a promising alternative against flaviviruses. Mucosal vaccination hasseveral advantages, as inducing long-term protective immunity in both mucosal andparenteral tissues. It constitutes a friendly route of antigen administrationbecause it is needle-free and allows for a variety of antigen delivery systems.This has promoted the development of several ways to stimulate immunity throughthe direct administration of antigens (e.g., inactivated virus, attenuated virus,subunits, and DNA), non-replicating vectors (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes,bacterial ghosts, and defective-replication viral vectors), and replicatingvectors (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,and viral vectors). Because of these characteristics, mucosal vaccination hasbeen explored for immunoprophylaxis against pathogens that enter the host throughmucosae or parenteral areas. It is suitable against flaviviruses because thistype of immunization can stimulate the parenteral responses required after bites from flavivirus-infected insects. This review focuses on the advantages ofmucosal vaccine candidates against the most relevant flaviviruses in eitherhumans or animals, providing supporting data on the feasibility of thisadministration route for future clinical trials.

TI  - Design to Implementation Study for Development and Patient Validation ofPaper-Based Toehold Switch Diagnostics.
LID - 10.3791/63223 [doi]
AB  - Access to low-burden molecular diagnostics that can be deployed into thecommunity for testing is increasingly important and has meaningful widerimplications for the well-being of societies and economic stability. Recent yearshave seen several new isothermal diagnostic modalities emerge to meet the needfor rapid, low-cost molecular diagnostics. We have contributed to this effortthrough the development and patient validation of toehold switch-baseddiagnostics, including diagnostics for the mosquito-borne Zika and chikungunyaviruses, which provided performance comparable to gold-standard reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) based assays.These diagnostics are inexpensive to develop and manufacture, and they have thepotential to provide diagnostic capacity to low-resource environments. Here theprotocol provides all the steps necessary for the development of a switch-basedassay for Zika virus detection. The article takes readers through the stepwisediagnostic development process. First, genomic sequences of Zika virus serve asinputs for the computational design of candidate switches using open-sourcesoftware. Next, the assembly of the sensors for empirical screening withsynthetic RNA sequences and optimization of diagnostic sensitivity is shown. Oncecomplete, validation is performed with patient samples in parallel with RT-qPCR, and a purpose-built optical reader, PLUM. This work provides a technical roadmap to researchers for the development of low-cost toehold switch-based sensors forapplications in human health, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The (re-)emergence of arboviruses in the Caribbean, and worldwide, isa major public health issue of concern to all scientific research stakeholders.This study aimed to use bibliometric analysis to identify the contribution ofCaribbean countries to scientific production regarding the three arboviruses withthe greatest impact, namely zika, chikungunya and dengue. METHOD: Bibliographicdata related to arbovirus diseases were collected from three internationaldatabases (Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus), filtered by Caribbean islands of affiliation. VosViewer was used to identify scientific connections betweencountries or institutions and to identify research themes. RESULTS: The datasetcomprised 1332 indexed articles, with 50% of articles categorized in the topquartile of quality. Cuba was found to lead research on dengue, with a total of300 articles, and 18 international connections. The USA-Puerto Rico duo was foundto be the leader on emerging arboviruses (Zika and Chikungunya), followed by apredominantly French-language cluster (mainland France, Guadeloupe, Martinique). Key research topics were related to clinical presentations, epidemiology, andresearch on mosquito-borne viruses CONCLUSIONS: Co-authorship network analysis onemerging arboviruses revealed the dynamics of collaboration, and providesinsights into Caribbean collaborations that deserve to be created andconsolidated in case of resurgence of new arbovirus epidemics.

AB  - The host-seeking activity of hematophagous arthropods is essential for arboviral transmission. Here, we demonstrate that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses canmanipulate host skin microbiota to produce a scent that attracts mosquitoes. Weobserved that Aedes mosquitoes preferred to seek and feed on mice infected bydengue and Zika viruses. Acetophenone, a volatile compound that is predominantly produced by the skin microbiota, was enriched in the volatiles from the infected hosts to potently stimulate mosquito olfaction for attractiveness. Of note,acetophenone emission was higher in dengue patients than in healthy people.Mechanistically, flaviviruses infection suppressed the expression of RELMalpha,an essential antimicrobial protein on host skin, thereby leading to the expansionof acetophenone-producing commensal bacteria and, consequently, a highacetophenone level. Given that RELMalpha can be specifically induced by a vitaminA derivative, the dietary administration of isotretinoin to flavivirus-infectedanimals interrupted flavivirus life cycle by reducing mosquito host-seekingactivity, thus providing a strategy of arboviral control.

AB  - This study examines how public perception of threat and efficacy (on self andothers) influence their tendency to take preventive action against the Zika virusby surveying 1,152 U.S. adults in Texas and Florida. Findings show thatindividuals were likely to take protective actions when they: (1) saw a high riskof the disease (high threat) and were confident about their ability to reduce thedanger (high efficacy); and (2) perceived others as having a high risk (highthreat), but lacked the ability to reduce the danger (low efficacy). Further, thestudy discusses practical implications for the design of public health campaigns.

TI  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide: a potential target for antiviral therapy.
PG  - 419-433
AB  - Viral infection is clinically common and some viral diseases, such as the ongoingglobal outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), have high morbidity andmortality. However, most viral infections are currently lacking in specifictherapeutic agents and effective prophylactic vaccines, due to inadequateresponse, increased rate of drug resistance and severe adverse side effects.Therefore, it is urgent to find new specific therapeutic targets for antiviraldefense among which "peptide-based therapeutics" is an emerging field. Peptidesmay be promising antiviral drugs because of their high efficacy and low toxicside effects. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a prospective antiviralpeptide. Since its successful isolation in 1970, VIP has been reported to beinvolved in infections of SARS-CoV-2, human immune deficiency virus (HIV),vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Zika virus(ZIKV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Additionally, given that viral attackssometimes cause severe complications due to overaction of inflammatory and immuneresponses, the potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulator properties of VIPfacilitate it to be a powerful and promising candidate. This review summarizesthe role and mechanisms of VIP in all reported viral infections and suggests its clinical potential as an antiviral therapeutic target.

TI  - Population-based surveillance for congenital zika virus syndrome: a latent class analysis of recorded cases from 2015-2018.
PG  - 530
LID - 10.1186/s12884-022-04860-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe clinical findings and determine themedium-term survival of congenital zika syndrome (CZS) suspected cases. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using routine register-based linked data. Itincluded all suspected cases of CZS born in Brazil from January 1, 2015, toDecember 31, 2018, and followed up from birth until death, 36 months, or December31, 2018, whichever came first. Latent class analysis was used to clusterunconfirmed cases into classes with similar combinations of anthropometry atbirth, imaging findings, maternally reported rash, region, and year of birth.Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted, and Cox proportional hazards models were fittedto determine mortality up to 36 months. RESULTS: We followed 11,850 suspectedcases of CZS, of which 28.3% were confirmed, 9.3% inconclusive and 62.4%unconfirmed. Confirmed cases had almost two times higher mortality when compared with unconfirmed cases. Among unconfirmed cases, we identified three distinctclusters with different mortality trajectories. The highest mortality risk wasobserved in those with abnormal imaging findings compatible with congenitalinfections (HR = 12.6; IC95%8.8-18.0) and other abnormalities (HR = 11.6;IC95%8.6-15.6) compared with those with normal imaging findings. The risk washigh in those with severe microcephaly (HR = 8.2; IC95%6.4-10.6) and macrocephaly(HR = 6.6; IC95%4.5-9.7) compared with normal head size. CONCLUSION: Abnormalimaging and head circumference appear to be the main drivers of the increasedmortality among suspected cases of CZS. We suggest identifying children who aremore likely to die and have a greater need to optimise interventions and resourceallocation regardless of the final diagnoses.

AB  - Worldwide, vector-transmitted diseases account for more than 17% of allinfectious diseases and cause more than 700,000 deaths annually. The primarystrategy to control the transmission of dengue, chikungunya and Zika focuses onthe control of their vectors. Vector control programs depend mainly on the use ofinsecticides. However, these measures have failed to yield the desired resultsbecause the lack of proper control decreases their effectiveness over time. Also,the effect of insecticide use on non-target organisms, environmentalcontamination, and the development of insecticide resistance impose continuouschallenges for insecticide-dependant control programs. The sterile insecttechnique, on the other hand, is a non-polluting and environment-friendlytechnique. The use of sterile insects is generally well established inagriculture, but human health interventions often require a consensus thatcombines social perceptions with scientific evidence. Factors associated withacceptance of the releases of sterile male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were assessedwith logistic regression models for two communities (Rio Florido and Hidalgo) in Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico. The favourable opinion of the respondents about theproject workers, and the fact that the releases of sterile mosquitoes would bemanaged by the Secretaria de Salud, were found to be factors that supported theacceptance of sterile mosquito releases. Factors associated with disapproval werecommunity (Rio Florido and Hidalgo) and the misbelief that sterile malemosquitoes can bite. The differences observed between the communities included inthis study might be the result of experiences with the releases, of social andcommunity organisation, and of leadership by social actors.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible forthe COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has a broad clinical spectrum from asymptomaticpatients to multiorgan dysfunction and septic shock. Most of the common symptoms of COVID-19 are classified as respiratory disorders, but some reports showneurological involvements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a case series ofneurological complications, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), were reported.GBS is a neuroimmune disorder with acute inflammatory radicular polyneuropathy indifferent parts of the peripheral nerve. Some studies have reported GBS as aninflammatory neuropathy related to various viral infections, such ascytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and Zika virus. There are someimmunomodulation approaches for the management of GBS. Studies have evaluated theeffects of the various therapeutic approaches, including intravenousimmunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange (PE), complement inhibitors, andcorticosteroids to regulate overactivation of immune responses during GBS inexperimental and clinical studies. In this regard, the possible associationbetween GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection during the outbreak of the current pandemic and also the mentioned therapeutic approaches were reviewed.

AB  - There is a pressing need for host-directed therapeutics that elicitbroad-spectrum antiviral activities to potentially address current and futureviral pandemics. Apratoxin S4 (Apra S4) is a potent Sec61 inhibitor that preventscotranslational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmicreticulum (ER), leading to anticancer and antiangiogenic activity both in vitroand in vivo. Since Sec61 has been shown to be an essential host factor for viral proteostasis, we tested Apra S4 in cellular models of viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and flaviviruses (Zika, West Nile, and Denguevirus). Apra S4 inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent mannerand had high potency particularly against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, with subnanomolar activity in human cells. Characterization studies focused onSARS-CoV-2 revealed that Apra S4 impacted a post-entry stage of the virallife-cycle. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Apra S4 blockedformation of stacked double-membrane vesicles, the sites of viral replication.Apra S4 reduced dsRNA formation and prevented viral protein production andtrafficking of secretory proteins, especially the spike protein. Given the potentand broad-spectrum activity of Apra S4, further preclinical evaluation of Apra S4and other Sec61 inhibitors as antivirals is warranted.

LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112306 [doi]
AB  - Recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Zikaepidemic in Brazil, have demonstrated both the importance and difficulty ofaccurately forecasting novel infectious diseases. When new diseases first emerge,we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and duration ofimmunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build realisticepidemiological models. Time series forecasts and machine learning, while lessreliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of data that are also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we examine how knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new diseases indata-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both an empirical and a synthetic approach. Using data from Brazil, we compare how well differentmachine learning models transfer knowledge between two different dataset pairs:case counts of (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) influenza and COVID-19. In thesynthetic analysis, we generate data with an SIR model using differenttransmission and recovery rates, and then compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning methods. We find that transfer learning offers the potential toimprove predictions, even beyond a model based on data from the target disease,though the appropriate source disease must be chosen carefully. While imperfect, these models offer an additional input for decision makers for pandemic response.

LID - 10.1111/dewb.12361 [doi]
AB  - In Brazil, the epicenter of the Zika crisis, brown, black, and indigenous poorwomen living in municipalities with scarce resources were disproportionallyaffected. The gendered consequences of the epidemic exposed how intersectionallenses are central to understand the impact of public health emergencies in thelives of women and girls. The demand for Zika-affected children and women to beresearch participants is relevant for an ethical analysis of participantprotection procedures during a crisis. We investigated how women experiencedresearch participation by analyzing their narratives. Two-year-long longitudinal qualitative study in Brazilian sites located in the epidemic's epicenter wasperformed using mixed methods: ethnography with women from two distinct statesand individual semi-structured interviews with five women in differentZika-affected states, four of which were community leaders. All women in thestudy were mothers or grandmothers of Zika-affected children. Thematic analysiswas used for data evaluation. Women perceived being pressured to participate inresearch and a lack of benefit sharing. Structural determinants of genderinequality, such as its effect on power distribution, were found to impactresearch participant protection. Formal procedures for research protocolsapprovals were insufficient in protecting participants because these instruments were unable to account for structural aspects. Communitarian mobilization,through WhatsApp groups, was found to be an important mechanism to createconditions to challenge oppressive structures. Strengthening public health,effective community-based participation in research planning and implantation of ethical strategies that promotes gender equality can have transformative effecton unequal power structures and promote participant protection.

TI  - Etiology of acute febrile illnesses in Southern China: Findings from a two-yearsentinel surveillance project, 2017-2019.
PG  - e0270586
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Southern China is at risk for arborvirus disease transmission,including Zika virus and dengue. Patients often present to clinical care withnon-specific acute febrile illnesses (AFI). To better describe the etiology ofAFI, we implemented a two-year AFI surveillance project at five sentinelhospitals in Yunnan and Guangdong Provinces. METHODS: Between June 2017 andAugust 2019, we enrolled patients between 2 and 65 years of age presenting at onesentinel hospital in Mengla County, Yunnan, and four in Jiangmen City, Guangdong,with symptoms of AFI (acute onset of fever >/= 37.5 degrees C within the past 7days) without respiratory symptoms or diarrhea. Demographic, epidemiologic, andclinical information was obtained and entered into a web-based AFI surveillancedatabase. A custom TaqMan Array card (TAC) was used to test patients' whole bloodspecimens for 27 different pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reactionassays. RESULTS: During the two-year project period, 836 patients were enrolled; 443 patients from Mengla County and 393 patients from Jiangmen City. The medianage was 33 years [range: 2-65], and most were hospitalized [641, 77%]. Of 796patients with valid TAC results, 341 (43%) were positive for at least one of the 10 unique pathogens detected. This included 205 (26%) patients positive fordengue virus, 60 (8%) for Orientia tsutsugamushi, and 42 (5%) for Coxiellaburnetii. Ten patients (1%) in Jiangmen City tested positive for malaria, 8 ofwhom reported recent travel outside of China. TAC results were negative for 455(57%) patients. None of the patients had a positive TAC detection for Zika virus.CONCLUSIONS: The project detected variability in the etiology of AFI in Southern China and highlighted the importance of differential diagnosis. Dengue, O.tsutsugamushi, and C. burnetii were the most frequently identified pathogensamong enrolled AFI patients. As a non-notifiable disease, the frequent detection of C. burnetii is noteworthy and warrants additional investigation. The projectprovided a framework for routine surveillance for persons presenting with AFI.

TI  - Zika virus infection drives epigenetic modulation of immunity by the histoneacetyltransferase CBP of Aedes aegypti.
PG  - e0010559
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010559 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for a wide range of biological phenomena ininsects, controlling embryonic development, growth, aging and nutrition. Despite this, the role of epigenetics in shaping insect-pathogen interactions hasreceived little attention. Gene expression in eukaryotes is regulated by histone acetylation/deacetylation, an epigenetic process mediated by histoneacetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study, weexplored the role of the Aedes aegypti histone acetyltransferase CBP (AaCBP)after infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), focusing on the two main immune tissues, the midgut and fat body. We showed that the expression and activity of AaCBPcould be positively modulated by blood meal and ZIKV infection. Nevertheless,Zika-infected mosquitoes that were silenced for AaCBP revealed a significantreduction in the acetylation of H3K27 (CBP target marker), followed bydownmodulation of the expression of immune genes, higher titers of ZIKV and lowersurvival rates. Importantly, in Zika-infected mosquitoes that were treated withsodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, their capacity to fight virusinfection was rescued. Our data point to a direct correlation among histonehyperacetylation by AaCBP, upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes andincreased survival of Zika-infected-A. aegypti.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The Hammersmith infant neurological examination (HINE) is a highlypredictive tool for the easy and low-cost detection of cerebral palsy. Between2015 and 2016, the rapid spread of the Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil wasresponsible for an increase in microcephaly cases. This study aimed to verify theaccuracy of the HINE for the early detection of neurological problems inBrazilian babies exposed to ZIKV.This was a cross sectional case-control study ofchildren exposed to ZIKV. This study was part of the Jundiai ZIKV Cohort. Of atotal sample of 782 children, 98 were evaluated (26 in the exposed group and 63in the control group). We included late preterm infants and term infants who wereexposed to the ZIKV and were participants in the ZIKV Cohort study. Student'st-test and stepwise multivariate logistic regression were used to comparegroups.Of the 26 items evaluated in the five scored categories of the HINE(cranial nerve function, posture, movements, tone, reflexes, and reactions), onlythe difference in ankle dorsiflexion between the exposed and the control groupswas statistically significant. However, some items showed a significant trend in relation to the control group.Our results demonstrated the importance of earlyneurological assessment of infants exposed to ZIKV, even in those without amicrocephaly diagnosis.

PG  - 103972
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103972 [doi]
AB  - As of 6 June 2022, a sum 25,782 of active cases and 524,701 deaths due toCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been recorded in India. Stewing in theflares of the pandemic, Kerala is entwined in the wrath of multiple emerginginfectious diseases. India, a home to 1.3 billion people, recently faced adevastating second wave of COVID-19 during May of 2021, with a ruckus of chronic shortage of medicine, oxygen supplies, ventilators, besides, being challenged by secondary infections and chronic health ailments. The state of Kerala, alonecontributes to 50% COVID-19 caseload, besides, recent simultaneous outbreaks ofZika Virus Disease (ZVD), Nipah Virus Disease (NiVD) and Kala-azar (black fever) on July 8, September 5 and 8, 2021 respectively. Syndemicity and a high casefatality rates of these highly contagious diseases coupled with post infectionsequelae, overwhelm the already fragile healthcare system. Thus, these lethalinfectious diseases along with an anticipated third wave of COVID-19 pose aserious public health threat in and around South India. With this narrativereview, we aim to discuss the challenges that the emergence of intersectingoutbreaks of Zika, Nipah, Kala-azar presents with, in the nation, amidst theglobal pandemic of COVID-19 and provide recommendations so as to help alleviatethe situation. The syndemicity of COVID-19 with other infectious diseases, calls for adequate surveillance and monitoring of diseases' outbreaks. To avoid theworst situations like pandemic, the health ministry, public and private healthstakeholders in India should strengthen the public healthcare delivery system andprovidence of quick medical facilities to control the rate of mortality andmorbidity during outbreaks.

AB  - Background: During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks of Zikawere reported from Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra, India in 2021. TheDengue and Chikungunya negative samples were retrospectively screened todetermine the presence of the Zika virus from different geographical regions ofIndia. Methods: During May to October 2021, the clinical samples of 1475patients, across 13 states and a union territory of India were screened andre-tested for Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika by CDC Trioplex Real time RT-PCR. The Zika rRTPCR positive samples were further screened with anti-Zika IgM and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test. Next generation sequencing was used for furthermolecular characterization. Results: The positivity was observed for Zika (67),Dengue (121), and Chikungunya (10) amongst screened cases. The co-infections ofDengue/Chikungunya, Dengue/Zika, and Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika were also observed. All Zika cases were symptomatic with fever (84%) and rash (78%) as majorpresenting symptoms. Of them, four patients had respiratory distress, onepresented with seizures, and one with suspected microcephaly at birth. The Asian Lineage of Zika and all four serotypes of Dengue were found in circulation.Conclusion: Our study indicates the spread of the Zika virus to several states ofIndia and an urgent need to strengthen its surveillance.

AB  - The development of high-throughput assays measuring Powassan virus (POWV) lineageI and II represents an important step in virological and immunological studies.By adapting focus-forming assays previously optimized for West Nile virus andZika virus, this protocol is able to determine viral load, evaluate antivirals,and measure neutralizing antibodies. Although limited by its requirement of adetection antibody, this protocol includes a rapid and high-throughput assay for measuring viral titer. By utilizing a baby hamster kidney cell line and a 96-wellplate format, this protocol allows for more sensitivity in the detection of POWV lineage I. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, pleaserefer to Stone et al. (2022).

AB  - Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) are primary vectors ofhuman arboviral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zikaviruses. Aedes aegypti is well distributed in Sudan, except in Northern andKhartoum states, while Ae. albopictus has not been previously reported. Recently,Eastern Sudan witnessed an unprecedented large outbreak of chikungunya feverbetween 31 May 2018 and 30 March 2019. The outbreak was composed of four waves;one of them was in Kassala state. Aedes survey in localities of Kassala state(rather than Kassala city) is carried out to assess the possible expansion of thedisease in the state. The results showed the presence of immature stages of Aedesspp. in four localities from ten localities. From the four localities thatrecorded Aedes spp., two localities (Rural Kassala and West Kassala) werereported with chikungunya cases. From this investigation, Ae. albopictus wasreported for the first time in Sudan. Also, this investigation showed theimportance of conducting entomological surveys with epidemiological surveysduring outbreaks of arboviral diseases.

PG  - 101478
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101478 [doi]
AB  - Background: Development and evaluation of diagnostics for diseases of epidemicpotential are often funded during epidemics, but not afterwards, leavingcountries unprepared for the next epidemic. United Nations Children's EmergencyFund (UNICEF) partnered with the United States Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID) to address this important gap by investing in an advancepurchase commitment (APC) mechanism to accelerate the development and evaluation of Zika rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for case detection and surveillance. Thispaper describes the performance evaluation of five Zika RDTs eligible forprocurement. Methods: A network of European Union-funded ZikaPLAN sites inAfrica, Asia, Latin America with access to relevant serum specimens were selectedto evaluate RDTs developed for the UNICEF APC mechanism. A standardised protocol and evaluation panels were developed and a call for specimens for the evaluation panels issued to different sites. Each site contributed specimens to theevaluation from their biobank. Data were collated, analysed and presented to the UNICEF Procurement Review Group for review. Findings: Three RDTs met the criteriafor UNICEF procurement of sensitivity and specificity of 85% against a refencestandard. The sensitivity/specificity of the ChemBio anti-Zika Virus (ZIKV)immunoglobulin M (IgM) test was 86.4 %/86.7% and the ChemBio ZCD system foranti-ZIKV IgM was 79.0%/97.1%, anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgM 90.0%/89.2%,anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) IgM 90.6%/97.2%. The sensitivity/specificity ofthe SD Biosensor anti-ZIKV IgM was 96.8 %/90.8%, anti-DENV IgM 71.8%/83.5%, theDENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) glycoprotein 90.0%/90.2%, anti- yellow fevervirus (YFV) IgM 84.6%/92.4%, anti-CHIKV IgM 86.3%/97.5%. Interpretation: ThreeRDTs fulfilled the performance thresholds set by WHO and were eligible for UNICEFprocurement. These tests will improve the diagnosis of ZIKV and other arboviralinfections as well as providing countries with better tools for surveillance and response to future epidemics. Funding: This work was supported by the USAID grantGHA-G-00-07-00007 and ZikaPLAN (European Union's Horizon 2020 Research andInnovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 734584).

PG  - 784443
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.784443 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of the Zika virus (ZIKV) has highlighted the need for a deeperunderstanding of virus-host interactions in order to pave the way for thedevelopment of antiviral therapies. The present work aimed to address theresponse of neutrophils during ZIKV infection. Neutrophils are important effectorcells in innate immunity implicated in the host's response to neurotropicarboviruses. Our results indicate that human neutrophils were not permissive toAsian or African ZIKV strain replication. In fact, after stimulation with ZIKV,neutrophils were mild primed against the virus as evaluated through CD11b andCD62L modulation, secretion of inflammatory cytokines and granule content,production of reactive oxygen species, and neutrophil extracellular trapsformation. Overall, neutrophils did not affect ZIKV infectivity. Moreover, invitro ZIKV infection of primary innate immune cells did not trigger neutrophilmigration. However, neutrophils co-cultured with ZIKV susceptible cell lineagesresulted in lower cell infection frequencies, possibly due to cell-to-cellcontact. In vivo, neutrophil depletion in immunocompetent mice did not affectZIKV spreading to the draining lymph nodes. The data suggest that humanneutrophils do not play an antiviral role against ZIKV per se, but these cellsmight participate in an infected environment shaping the ZIKV infection in other target cells.

TI  - Azelnidipine Exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo Antiviral Effects against FlavivirusInfections by Targeting the Viral RdRp.
LID - 1228 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061228 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses, represented by Zika and dengue virus (ZIKV and DENV), are widelypresent around the world and cause various diseases with serious consequences.However, no antiviral drugs have been clinically approved for use against them.Azelnidipine (ALP) is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and has beenapproved for use as an antihypertensive drug. In the present study, ALP was foundto show potent anti-flavivirus activities in vitro and in vivo. ALP effectivelyprevented the cytopathic effect induced by ZIKV and DENV and inhibited theproduction of viral RNA and viral protein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover,treatment with 0.3 mg/kg of ALP protected 88.89% of mice from lethal challenge.Furthermore, using the time-of-drug-addition assay, the enzymatic inhibitionassay, the molecular docking, and the surface plasmon resonance assay, werevealed that ALP acted at the replication stage of the viral infection cycle by targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These findings highlight thepotential for the use of ALP as an antiviral agent to combat flavivirusinfections.

LID - 10.3390/v14061226 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne flavivirus infections affect approximately 400 million peopleworldwide each year and are global threats to public health. The common diseases caused by such flaviviruses include West Nile, yellow fever, dengue, Zikainfection and Japanese encephalitis, which may result in severe symptoms anddisorders of multiple organs or even fatal outcomes. Till now, no specificantiviral agents are commercially available for the treatment of the diseases.Numerous strategies have been adopted to develop novel and promising inhibitorsagainst mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including drugs targeting the critical viralcomponents or essential host factors during infection. Research advances inantiflaviviral therapy might optimize and widen the treatment options forflavivirus infection. This review summarizes the current developmental progressesand involved molecular mechanisms of antiviral agents against mosquito-borneflaviviruses.

TI  - Cross-Reactive Immunity among Five Medically Important Mosquito-BorneFlaviviruses Related to Human Diseases.
LID - 1213 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061213 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses cause a spectrum of potentially severe diseases. Most flavivirusesare transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks and are widely distributed all over theworld. Among them, several mosquito-borne flaviviruses are co-epidemic, and thesimilarity of their antigenicity creates abundant cross-reactive immune responseswhich complicate their prevention and control. At present, only effectivevaccines against yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis have been usedclinically, while the optimal vaccines against other flavivirus diseases arestill under development. The antibody-dependent enhancement generated bycross-reactive immune responses against different serotypes of dengue virus makesthe development of the dengue fever vaccine a bottleneck. It has been proposedthat the cross-reactive immunity elicited by prior infection of mosquito-borneflavivirus could also affect the outcome of the subsequent infection ofheterologous flavivirus. In this review, we focused on five medically importantflaviviruses, and rearranged and recapitulated their cross-reactive immunity indetail from the perspectives of serological experiments in vitro, animalexperiments in vivo, and human cohort studies. We look forward to providingreferences and new insights for the research of flavivirus vaccines and specific prevention.

TI  - EGR1 Upregulation during Encephalitic Viral Infections Contributes toInflammation and Cell Death.
LID - 1210 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061210 [doi]
AB  - Early growth response 1 (EGR1) is an immediate early gene and transcriptionfactor previously found to be significantly upregulated in human astrocytomacells infected with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). The loss of EGR1resulted in decreased cell death but had no significant impact on viralreplication. Here, we extend these studies to determine the impacts of EGR1 ongene expression following viral infection. Inflammatory genes CXCL3, CXCL8,CXCL10, TNF, and PTGS2 were upregulated in VEEV-infected cells, which waspartially dependent on EGR1. Additionally, transcription factors, including EGR1 itself, as well as ATF3, FOS, JUN, KLF4, EGR2, and EGR4 were found to bepartially transcriptionally dependent on EGR1. We also examined the role of EGR1 and the changes in gene expression in response to infection with otheralphaviruses, including eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Sindbis virus(SINV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), as well as Zika virus (ZIKV) and RiftValley fever virus (RVFV), members of the Flaviviridae and Phenuiviridaefamilies, respectively. EGR1 was significantly upregulated to varying degrees in EEEV-, CHIKV-, RVFV-, SINV-, and ZIKV-infected astrocytoma cells. Genes that wereidentified as being partially transcriptionally dependent on EGR1 in infectedcells included ATF3 (EEEV, CHIKV, ZIKV), JUN (EEEV), KLF4 (SINV, ZIKV, RVFV),CXCL3 (EEEV, CHIKV, ZIKV), CXCL8 (EEEV, CHIKV, ZIKV, RVFV), CXCL10 (EEEV, RVFV), TNF-alpha (EEEV, ZIKV, RVFV), and PTGS2 (EEEV, CHIKV, ZIKV). Additionally,inhibition of the inflammatory gene PTGS2 with Celecoxib, a small moleculeinhibitor, rescued astrocytoma cells from VEEV-induced cell death but had noimpact on viral titers. Collectively, these results suggest that EGR1 inductionfollowing viral infection stimulates multiple inflammatory mediators. Managinginflammation and cell death in response to viral infection is of utmostimportance, especially during VEEV infection where survivors are at-risk forneurological sequalae.

AB  - Knowledge of how congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) impacts motor development ofchildren longitudinally is important to guide management. The objective of thepresent study was to describe the evolution of gross motor function in childrenwith CZS in a Rio de Janeiro hospital. In children with CZS withoutarthrogryposis or other congenital osteoarticular malformations who were followedin a prospective cohort study, motor performance was evaluated at two timepoints using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Gross Motor Function Measurement test (GMFM-88). Among 74 children, at the baselineevaluation, the median age was 13 (8-24) months, and on follow-up, 28 (24-48)months. According to GMFCS at the second timepoint, 6 children were classified asmild, 11 as moderate, and 57 as severe. In the GMFM-88 assessment, children inthe severe group had a median score of 10.05 in the baseline evaluation and afollow-up score of 12.40, the moderate group had median scores of 25.60 and29.60, and the mild group had median scores of 82.60 and 91.00, respectively.Although a small developmental improvement was observed, the motor impairment of children was mainly consistent with severe cerebral palsy. Baseline motorfunction assessments were predictive of prognosis.

AB  - Flaviviruses replicate in membrane factories associated with the endoplasmicreticulum (ER). Significant levels of flavivirus viral protein accumulationcontribute to ER stress. As a consequence, the host cell exhibits an UnfoldedProtein Response (UPR), subsequently stimulating appropriate cellular responsessuch as adaptation, autophagy or apoptosis. The correct redox conditions of this compartment are essential to forming native disulfide bonds in proteins. Zikavirus (ZIKV) has the ability to induce persistent ER stress leading to theactivation of UPR pathways. In this study, we wondered whether ZIKV affects theredox balance and consequently the oxidative protein folding in the ER. We found that ZIKV replication influences the redox state, leading to the aggregation ofthe viral envelope protein as amyloid-like structures in the infected cells.

AB  - Dengue virus and Zika virus are mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive-senseRNA viruses that belong to the Flaviviridae family. Both the viruses are closely related and have similarities with other flaviviruses. Dengue virus (DENV) causesa severe febrile illness with fever, joint pain, and rash leading to alife-threatening condition in severe cases. While Zika virus (ZIKV) primarilycauses mild fever, it can be passed from a pregnant mother to her fetus,resulting in severe birth defect microcephaly and even causing a rare autoimmune disease-Guillain-Barre syndrome. To date, there are no approved DENV and ZIKAvaccines available, except a Dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.,Lyon, France) recently approved to be used only for 9-16 years of age groupsliving in endemic areas and having a previous record of confirmed dengueinfection. There are several potential vaccine candidates in the clinical trials based on multiple vaccine platforms, such as live attenuated, subunit, nucleicacid, and viral vector-based vaccines. In the current review, we have focusedexclusively on the nucleic acid vaccine platform and discussed the progress ofall the DNA/RNA vaccine candidates under preclinical and clinical studies forDENV and ZIKA viruses. Additionally, we have described a brief history of theemergence of these flaviviruses, major structural similarities between them,prominent vaccine targets, and the mechanism of virus entry and infection.

TI  - Near-Infrared Spectroscopy as a Potential COVID-19 Early Detection Method: AReview and Future Perspective.
LID - 4391 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22124391 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide health anxiety.The rapid dispersion of the infection globally results in unparalleled economic, social, and health impacts. The pathogen that causes COVID-19 is known as asevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A fast and low-costdiagnosis method for COVID-19 disease can play an important role in controllingits proliferation. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a quick, non-destructive,non-invasive, and inexpensive technique for profiling the chemical and physicalstructures of a wide range of samples. Furthermore, the NIRS has the advantage ofincorporating the internet of things (IoT) application for the effective control and treatment of the disease. In recent years, a significant advancement ininstrumentation and spectral analysis methods has resulted in a remarkable impacton the NIRS applications, especially in the medical discipline. To date, NIRS hasbeen applied as a technique for detecting various viruses including zika (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), influenza, hepatitis C, dengue (DENV), and humanimmunodeficiency (HIV). This review aims to outline some historical andcontemporary applications of NIRS in virology and its merit as a novel diagnostictechnique for SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Genetic Diversity among Four Populations of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)from Honduras as Revealed by Mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I.
LID - 620 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060620 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a hematophagous and highly anthropophilic mosquito with a widedistribution, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Ae. aegypti is the main vector of several febrile diseases called arboviruses(dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses), which represent animportant public health problem. Populations of this mosquito were nearlyeliminated from the Americas in the mid-20th century; however, after theabandonment of control measures, mosquito populations have been recoveringterritory, have expanded by anthropogenic mechanisms, and have been joined by newpopulations reintroduced from other continents. The objective of this pilot studywas to determine the genetic variability of Aedes aegypti collected in fourcities located along the so-called logistics corridor of Honduras, which connectsthe Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean. We studied the sequences of two molecularmarkers: the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI mtDNA) gene and the internal transcribedspacer 2 (ITS2 rDNA) of 40 mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyzes show two separateclades with a low number of nucleotide differences per site, three haplotypes,and low haplotype diversity. These results suggest a low genetic diversity in thepopulations of Ae. aegypti in Honduras in relation to that reported in othercountries of the Central American isthmus.

TI  - Flavivirus NS1 Triggers Tissue-Specific Disassembly of Intercellular JunctionsLeading to Barrier Dysfunction and Vascular Leak in a GSK-3beta-Dependent Manner.
LID - 615 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060615 [doi]
AB  - The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction and vascular leak in atissue-dependent manner. This phenomenon occurs in part via disruption of theendothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) lining the endothelium. Additionally, we andothers have shown that soluble DENV NS1 induces disassembly of intercellularjunctions (IJCs), a group of cellular proteins critical for maintainingendothelial homeostasis and regulating vascular permeability; however, thespecific mechanisms by which NS1 mediates IJC disruption remain unclear. Here, weinvestigated the relative contribution of five flavivirus NS1 proteins, fromdengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), andyellow fever (YFV) viruses, to the expression and localization of theintercellular junction proteins beta-catenin and VE-cadherin in endothelial cellsfrom human umbilical vein and brain tissues. We found that flavivirus NS1 inducedthe mislocalization of beta-catenin and VE-cadherin in a tissue-dependent manner,reflecting flavivirus disease tropism. Mechanistically, we observed that NS1treatment of cells triggered internalization of VE-cadherin, likely viaclathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of beta-catenin, part of acanonical IJC remodeling pathway during breakdown of endothelial barriers thatactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Supporting this model, wefound that a chemical inhibitor of GSK-3beta reduced both NS1-inducedpermeability of human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cellmonolayers in vitro and vascular leakage in a mouse dorsal intradermal model.These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulatingNS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction and identify GSK-3beta as a potentialtherapeutic target for treatment of vascular leakage during severe denguedisease.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19127319 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause of pregnancy loss andmultiple clinical and neurological anomalies in children. This systematic review aimed to assess the effect of ZIKV exposure in utero on the long-termneurodevelopment of normocephalic children born to women with ZIKV infection inpregnancy. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines forsystematic reviews and meta-analyses. We performed a random effects meta-analysisto estimate the cross-study prevalence of neurodevelopmental delays in childrenusing the Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III). The riskof bias was assessed using Cochrane's Grading of Recommendations Assessment,Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Full-text reviews were performed for566 articles, and data were extracted from 22 articles corresponding to 20studies. Nine articles including data from 476 children found 6.5% (95% CI:4.1-9.3) of infants and children to have any type of non-language cognitivedelay; 29.7% (95% CI: 21.7-38.2) to have language delay; and 11.5% (95% CI:4.8-20.1) to have any type of motor delay. The pooled estimates had a high level of heterogeneity; thus, results should be interpreted with caution. Largerprospective studies that include a non-exposed control group are needed toconfirm whether ZIKV exposure in utero is associated with adverse childneurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - Natural plant-derived baicalein which is extracted from Chinese herb Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi belongs to the flavonoid compounds and possesses multiplepharmacological activities. In this study, we designed and synthesized new seriesof derivatives of baicalein (BE) through catalytic coupling reactions, andscreened for their antiviral activity against arboviruses including Chikungunyavirus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) or Zika virus (ZIKV). Our results revealedfor the first time that BE and its derivatives had potent anti-CHIKV, anti-WNVand anti-ZIKV effects. And modification of 8 or 4' position could lead to obtain potent antiviral compounds against CHIKV, WNV and ZIKV with lower cytotoxicity.Among the baicalein derivatives, C3 and F3 showed the most potent antiviralactivities against CHIKV, WNV and ZIKV, which were 5-10 times more potent thanbaicalein. Our findings will provide research basis for the development ofbaicalein derivatives as effective antiviral agents.

AB  - Over half the world's population is at risk for viruses transmitted by Aedesmosquitoes, such as dengue and Zika. The primary vector, Aedes aegypti, thrivesin urban environments. Despite decades of effort, cases and geographic range ofAedes-borne viruses (ABVs) continue to expand. Rigorously proven vector controlinterventions that measure protective efficacy against ABV diseases are limitedto Wolbachia in a single trial in Indonesia and do not include any chemicalintervention. Spatial repellents, a new option for efficient deployment, aredesigned to decrease human exposure to ABVs by releasing active ingredients into the air that disrupt mosquito-human contact. A parallel, cluster-randomizedcontrolled trial was conducted in Iquitos, Peru, to quantify the impact of atransfluthrin-based spatial repellent on human ABV infection. From 2,907households across 26 clusters (13 per arm), 1,578 participants were assessed for seroconversion (primary endpoint) by survival analysis. Incidence of acutedisease was calculated among 16,683 participants (secondary endpoint). Adultmosquito collections were conducted to compare Ae. aegypti abundance, blood-fedrate, and parity status through mixed-effect difference-in-difference analyses.The spatial repellent significantly reduced ABV infection by 34.1% (one-sided 95%CI lower limit, 6.9%; one-sided P value = 0.0236, z = 1.98). Aedes aegyptiabundance and blood-fed rates were significantly reduced by 28.6 (95% CI 24.1%,infinity); z = -9.11) and 12.4% (95% CI 4.2%, infinity); z = -2.43),respectively. Our trial provides conclusive statistical evidence from anappropriately powered, preplanned cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial ofthe impact of a chemical intervention, in this case a spatial repellent, toreduce the risk of ABV transmission compared to a placebo.

LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7060106 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is mosquito-borne flavivirus that caused a significant publichealth concern in French Polynesia and South America. The two major complicationsthat gained the most media attention during the ZIKV outbreak were Guillain-Barresyndrome (GBS) and microcephaly in newborn infants. The two modes of ZIKVtransmission are the vector-borne and non-vector borne modes of transmission.Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the most important vectors of ZIKV. ZIKVbinds to surface receptors on permissive cells that support infection andreplication, such as neural progenitor cells, dendritic cells, dermalfibroblasts, retinal pigment epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages,epidermal keratinocytes, and trophoblasts to cause infection. The innate immuneresponse to ZIKV infection is mediated by interferons and natural killer cells,whereas the adaptive immune response is mediated by CD8(+)T cells, Th1 cells, andneutralizing antibodies. The non-structural proteins of ZIKV, such asnon-structural protein 5, are involved in the evasion of the host's immunedefense mechanisms. Ocular manifestations of ZIKV arise from the virus' abilityto cross both the blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier, as well as theblood-aqueous barrier. Most notably, this results in the development of GBS, arare neurological complication in acute ZIKV infection. This can yield ocularsymptoms and signs. Additionally, infants to whom ZIKV is transmittedcongenitally develop congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The ocular manifestationsare widely variable, and include nonpurulent conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis,keratitis, trabeculitis, congenital glaucoma, microphthalmia, hypoplastic opticdisc, and optic nerve pallor. There are currently no FDA approved therapeuticagents for treating ZIKV infections and, as such, a meticulous ocular examinationis an important aspect of the diagnosis. This review utilized several publishedarticles regarding the ocular findings of ZIKV, antiviral immune responses toZIKV infection, and the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations in individuals withZIKV infection. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the viralimmunology of ZIKV, interactions between ZIKV and the host's immune defensemechanism, pathological mechanisms, as well as anterior and posterior segmentfindings associated with ZIKV infection.

AB  - Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are arboviral diseases for which there are noeffective therapies or vaccines. The only way to avoid their transmission is bycontrolling the vector Aedes aegypti, but insecticide resistance limits thisstrategy. To generate relevant information for surveillance and controlmechanisms, we determined life cycle parameters, including longevity, fecundity, and mortality, of Colombian Ae. aegypti populations from four differentgeographical regions: Neiva, Bello, Itagui, and Riohacha. When reared at 28degrees C, Bello had the shortest development time, and Riohacha had the longest.Each mosquito population had its own characteristic fecundity pattern during fourgonotrophic cycles. The survival curves of each population were significantlydifferent, with Riohacha having the longest survival in both males and femalesand Bello the shortest. High mortality was observed in mosquitoes from Neiva inthe egg stage and for Bello in the pupae stage. Finally, when mosquitoes fromNeiva and Bello were reared at 35 degrees C, development times and mortality wereseverely affected. In conclusion, each population has a unique developmentpattern with an innate trace in their biological characteristics that confersvulnerability in specific stages of development.

LID - 10.26574/maedica.2022.17.1.201 [doi]
AB  - Introduction:Vector-borne diseases are infections caused by parasites, virusesand bacteria and transmitted by vectors, which are usually insects. A greaterrisk of diseases such as dengue, malaria, seasonal influenza, leptospirosis,chikungunya, enteric fever, etc co-exist in COVID-19 cases. This poses challengesin clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, which may affect clinicalmanagement and patient outcomes. Methodology: Several databases, includingPubMed, Scopus, DOAJ, and EMBASE, were reviewed using the keywords vector-borneinfections in India amidst COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 23 articles and WHO and National website for vector-borne diseases was found. Review:For many decades,vector-borne diseases have been a major health burden for both underdeveloped anddeveloping countries, including India. With better preparedness, the threat ofclimate change on vector-borne diseases may be negated. Rains during monsoonincrease not only the risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue,chikungunya but also that of food- and water-borne diseases as well as other skininfections. A greater risk of diseases such as dengue, malaria, seasonalinfluenza, leptospirosis, chikungunya, enteric fever, etc co-exists in COVID-19cases. This poses challenges in clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19,which may affect clinical management and patient outcomes (3). Amidst theCOVID-19 pandemic, a sudden outbreak of Zika virus infection was reported at the beginning of July 2021 in the districts of Kerala, from where it started,spreading to the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, India.Conclusions:With better preparedness, the threat of climate change onvector-borne diseases may be negated. Designing and strengthening an interventionstrategy for environmental sanitation, regular cleaning of living houses, andkeeping personal hygiene shall be considered. Risk assessment is crucial tooptimize surveillance, preventative measures (vector control), and resourceallocation (medical supplies).

TI  - Zika Virus Strains and Dengue Virus Induce Distinct Proteomic Changes in NeuralStem Cells and Neurospheres.
LID - 10.1007/s12035-022-02922-3 [doi]
AB  - Brain abnormalities and congenital malformations have been linked to thecirculating strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil since 2016 during themicrocephaly outbreak; however, the molecular mechanisms behind several of these alterations and differential viral molecular targets have not been fullyelucidated. Here we explore the proteomic alterations induced by ZIKV bycomparing the Brazilian (Br ZIKV) and the African (MR766) viral strains, inaddition to comparing them to the molecular responses to the Dengue virus type 2 (DENV). Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPSCs)were cultured both as monolayers and in suspension (resulting in neurospheres),which were then infected with ZIKV (Br ZIKV or ZIKV MR766) or DENV to assessalterations within neural cells. Large-scale proteomic analyses allowed thecomparison not only between viral strains but also regarding the two- andthree-dimensional cellular models of neural cells derived from iPSCs, and theeffects on their interaction. Altered pathways and biological processes wereobserved related to cell death, cell cycle dysregulation, and neurogenesis. Theseresults reinforce already published data and provide further informationregarding the biological alterations induced by ZIKV and DENV in neural cells.

TI  - Smartphone clip-on instrument and microfluidic processor for rapidsample-to-answer detection of Zika virus in whole blood using spatial RT-LAMP.
LID - 10.1039/d2an00438k [doi]
AB  - Rapid, simple, inexpensive, accurate, and sensitive point-of-care (POC) detectionof viral pathogens in bodily fluids is a vital component of controlling thespread of infectious diseases. The predominant laboratory-based methods forsample processing and nucleic acid detection face limitations that prevent themfrom gaining wide adoption for POC applications in low-resource settings andself-testing scenarios. Here, we report the design and characterization of anintegrated system for rapid sample-to-answer detection of a viral pathogen in adroplet of whole blood comprised of a 2-stage microfluidic cartridge for sampleprocessing and nucleic acid amplification, and a clip-on detection instrumentthat interfaces with the image sensor of a smartphone. The cartridge is designed to release viral RNA from Zika virus in whole blood using chemical lysis,followed by mixing with the assay buffer for performing reverse-transcriptaseloop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions in six parallelmicrofluidic compartments. The battery-powered handheld detection instrumentuniformly heats the compartments from below, and an array of LEDs illuminatesfrom above, while the generation of fluorescent reporters in the compartments is kinetically monitored by collecting a series of smartphone images. Wecharacterize the assay time and detection limits for detecting Zika RNA and gammaray-deactivated Zika virus spiked into buffer and whole blood and compare theperformance of the same assay when conducted in conventional PCR tubes. Ourapproach for kinetic monitoring of the fluorescence-generating process in themicrofluidic compartments enables spatial analysis of early fluorescent "bloom"events for positive samples, in an approach called "Spatial LAMP" (S-LAMP). Weshow that S-LAMP image analysis reduces the time required to designate an assayas a positive test, compared to conventional analysis of the average fluorescent intensity of the entire compartment. S-LAMP enables the RT-LAMP process to be as short as 22 minutes, resulting in a total sample-to-answer time in the range of17-32 minutes to distinguish positive from negative samples, while demonstrating a viral RNA detection as low as 2.70 x 10(2) copies per mul, and agamma-irradiated virus of 10(3) virus particles in a single 12.5 mul dropletblood sample.

TI  - Mitigating the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections with vector-borneagents solely by means of pathogen reduction.
PG  - 1388-1398
LID - 10.1111/trf.16950 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether pathogen reduction technology (PRT) inplasma and platelets using amotosalen/ultraviolet A light (A/UVA) or in red bloodcells using amustaline/glutathione (S-303/GSH) may be used as the sole mitigationstrategy preventing transfusion-transmitted West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viral, and Babesia microti, Trypanosoma cruzi,and Plasmodium parasitic infections. METHODS: Antibody (Ab) status and pathogenloads (copies/mL) were obtained for donations from US blood donors testingnucleic acid (NAT)-positive for WNV, DENV, ZIKV, CHIKV, and B. microti.Infectivity titers derived from pathogen loads were compared to published PRTlog10 reduction factors (LRF); LRFs were also reviewed for Plasmodium and T.cruzi. The potential positive impact on donor retention following removal ofdeferrals from required questioning and testing for WNV, Babesia, Plasmodium, andT. cruzi was estimated for American Red Cross (ARC) donors. RESULTS: A/UVA andS-303/GSH reduced infectivity to levels in accordance with those recognized byFDA as suitable to replace testing for all agents evaluated. If PRT replaceddeferrals resulting from health history questions and/or NAT for WNV, Babesia,Plasmodium, and T. cruzi, 27,758 ARC donors could be retained allowingapproximately 50,000 additional donations/year based on 1.79 donations/donor for calendar year 2019 (extrapolated to an estimated 125,000 additional donationsnationally). CONCLUSION: Pathogen loads in donations from US blood donorsdemonstrated that robust PRT may provide an opportunity to replace deferralsassociated with donor questioning and NAT for vector-borne agents allowing forsignificant donor retention and likely increased blood availability.

AB  - Western Africa is vulnerable to arboviral disease transmission, having recentlyexperienced major outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika.However, there have been relatively few studies on the natural history of the twomajor human arbovirus vectors in this region, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus,potentially limiting the implementation of effective vector control. Wesystematically searched for and reviewed relevant studies on the behaviour andecology of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Western Africa, published over thelast 40 years. We identified 73 relevant studies, over half of which wereconducted in Nigeria, Senegal, or Cote d'Ivoire. Most studies investigated theecology of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, exploring the impact of seasonalityand land cover on mosquito populations and identifying aquatic habitats. Thisreview highlights the adaptation of Ae. albopictus to urban environments and its invasive potential, and the year-round maintenance of Ae. aegypti populations in water storage containers. However, important gaps were identified in theliterature on the behaviour of both species, particularly Ae. albopictus. InWestern Africa, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus appear to be mainly anthropophilicand to bite predominantly during the day, but further research is needed toconfirm this to inform planning of effective vector control strategies. Wediscuss the public health implications of these findings and comment on thesuitability of existing and novel options for control in Western Africa.

TI  - Congenital Zika syndrome and living conditions in the largest city ofnortheastern Brazil.
PG  - 1231
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13614-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic hit Brazil in 2015 and resulted in ageneration of children at risk of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The socialvulnerability of certain segments of the population contributed to thedisproportional occurrence of CZS in the Brazilian Northeast, the poorest region in the country. Living conditions are essential factors in understanding thesocial determination of CZS, which is embedded in a complex interaction betweenbiological, environmental, and social factors. Salvador, the biggest city in the region, played a central role in the context of the epidemic and was a pioneer inreporting the ZIKV infection and registering a high number of cases of CZS. Theaim of the study was identifying the incidence and spatial distribution patternof children with CZS in the municipality of Salvador, according to livingconditions. METHODS: This is an ecological study that uses the reported cases of ZIKV and CZS registered in the epidemiological surveillance database of theMunicipal Secretariat of Health of the city of Salvador between August of 2015and July of 2016. The neighborhoods formed the analysis units and the thematicmaps were built based on the reported cases. Associations between CZS and living conditions were assessed using the Kernel ratio and a spatial autoregressivelinear regression model. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty-six live births werereported, of which 236 (32.5%) were confirmed for CZS. Despite the reports ofZIKV infection being widely distributed, the cases of CZS were concentrated inpoor areas of the city. A positive spatial association was observed betweenliving in places with poorer living conditions and births of children with CZS.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the role of living conditions in the occurrence of births of children with CZS and indicates the need for approaches that recognize the part played by social inequalities in determining CZS and in caring for thechildren affected.

AB  - Flavivirus Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein performs multiple functions and it ishighly plausible that significant structural and folding dynamics of NS1 mightplay a role in its multifunctionality. It is important to understand thestructural conformations of NS1 and its domains in isolation, possiblyhighlighting the implications on the overall NS1 protein dynamics. Therefore, we have employed extensively long molecular dynamic (MD) simulations inunderstanding the dynamics of the three structural domains (i.e., beta-roll,wing, and beta-ladder) in isolation, as a reductionist approach. We also foundthat the beta-ladder domain is highly flexible, while the beta-roll domain isdisordered during long simulations. Further, we experimentally validated ourfindings using CD spectroscopy and confirmed the intrinsically disorderedbehavior of NS1 beta-roll in isolation and lipid mimetic environments. Therefore,we believe this study may have implications for significant dynamics played byNS1 protein, specifically during oligomerization of NS1.

TI  - Animal venoms as a source of antiviral peptides active against arboviruses: asystematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05494-8 [doi]
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunyavirus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus(WNV), are pathogens of global importance. Therefore, there has been anincreasing need for new drugs for the treatment of these viral infections. Inthis context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) obtained from animal venoms stand outas promising compounds because they exhibit strong antiviral activity againstemerging arboviral pathogens. Thus, we systematically searched and criticallyanalyzed in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated the anti-arbovirus effect ofpeptide derivatives from toxins produced by vertebrates and invertebrates.Thirteen studies that evaluated the antiviral action of 10 peptides againstarboviruses were included in this review. The peptides were derived from thevenom of scorpions, spiders, wasps, snakes, sea snails, and frogs and were testedagainst DENV, ZIKV, YFV, WNV, and CHIKV. Despite the high structural variety ofthe peptides included in this study, their antiviral activity appears to beassociated with the presence of positive charges, an excess of basic amino acids (mainly lysine), and a high isoelectric point (above 8). These peptides usedifferent antiviral mechanisms, the most common of which is the inhibition ofviral replication, release, entry, or fusion. Moreover, peptides with virucidaland cytoprotective (pre-treatment) effects were also identified. In conclusion,animal-venom-derived peptides stand out as a promising alternative in the search and development of prototype antivirals against arboviruses.

AB  - From many decades, emerging infections have threatened humanity. The pandemicscaused by different CoVs have already claimed and will continue to claim millionsof lives. The SARS, Ebola, MERS epidemics and the most recent emergence ofCOVID-19 pandemic have threatened populations across borders. Since a highlypathogenic CoV has been evolved into the human population in the twenty-firstcentury known as SARS, scientific advancements and innovative methods to tacklethese viruses have increased in order to improve response preparedness towardsthe unpredictable threat posed by these rapidly emerging pathogens. Recentlypublished review articles on SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its pathogenesis, epidemiology and available treatments. However, in this review, we have done asystematic comparison of all three CoVs i.e., SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 alongwith Ebola and Zika in terms of their epidemiology, virology, clinical featuresand current treatment strategies. This review focuses on important emerging RNAviruses starting from Zika, Ebola and the CoVs which include SARS, MERS andSARS-CoV-2. Each of these viruses has been elaborated on the basis of theirepidemiology, virulence, transmission and treatment. However, special attentionhas been given to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by it i.e., COVID-19 due tocurrent havoc caused worldwide. At the end, insights into the currentunderstanding of the lessons learned from previous epidemics to combat emergingCoVs have been described. The travel-related viral spread, the unprecedentednosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates associated with thesehighly transmissible and pathogenic viruses highlight the need for newprophylactic and therapeutic actions which include but are not limited toclinical indicators, contact tracing, and laboratory investigations as important factors that need to be taken into account in order to arrive at the finalconclusion.

AB  - Arboviruses are a group of diseases that are transmitted by an arthropod vector. Since they are part of the Neglected Tropical Diseases that pose several publichealth challenges for countries around the world. The arboviruses' dynamics aregoverned by a combination of climatic, environmental, and human mobility factors.Arboviruses prediction models can be a support tool for decision-making by publichealth agents. In this study, we propose a systematic literature review toidentify arboviruses prediction models, as well as models for their transmittervector dynamics. To carry out this review, we searched reputable scientific basessuch as IEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Scopus. We search for studies published between the years 2015 and 2020, using a search string. Atotal of 429 articles were returned, however, after filtering by exclusion andinclusion criteria, 139 were included. Through this systematic review, it waspossible to identify the challenges present in the construction of arbovirusesprediction models, as well as the existing gap in the construction ofspatiotemporal models.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus mainly transmitted by mosquitos of the genusAedes. The first cases of ZIKV infection in South America occurred in Brazil in2015. The infection in humans causes diverse symptoms from asymptomatic to asyndrome-like dengue infection with fever, arthralgia, and myalgia. Furthermore, ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with fetal microcephaly andneurological disorders. The identification of host molecular mechanismsresponsible for the modulation of different signaling pathways in response toZIKV is the first step to finding potential biomarkers and therapeutic targetsand understanding disease outcomes. In the last decade, it has been shown thatmicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators involved invirtually all cellular processes. miRNAs present in body fluids can not onlyserve as key biomarkers for diagnostics and prognosis of human disorders but alsocontribute to cellular signaling offering new insights into pathologicalmechanisms. Here, we describe for the first time ZIKV-induced changes in miRNAplasma levels in patients during the acute and recovery phases of infection. Weobserved that during ZIKV acute infection, among the dysregulated miRNAs (DMs),the majority is with decreased levels when compared to convalescent and controlpatients. We used systems biology tools to build and highlight biologicalinteractions between miRNAs and their multiple direct and indirect targetmolecules. Among the 24 DMs identified in ZIKV + patients, miR-146, miR-125a-5p, miR-30-5p, and miR-142-3p were related to signaling pathways modulated duringinfection and immune response. The results presented here are an effort to opennew vistas for the key roles of miRNAs during ZIKV infection.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the challenges we face as a globalsociety in preventing and containing emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Multipleintersecting factors, including environmental changes, host immunologicalfactors, and pathogen dynamics, are intimately connected to the emergence andre-emergence of communicable diseases. There is a large and expanding list ofcommunicable diseases that can cause neurological damage, either through director indirect routes. Novel pathogens of neurotropic potential have been identifiedthrough advanced diagnostic techniques, including metagenomic next-generationsequencing, but there are also known pathogens which have expanded theirgeographic distribution to infect non-immune individuals. Factors includingpopulation growth, climate change, the increase in animal and human interface,and an increase in international travel and trade are contributing to theexpansion of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Challenges exist aroundantimicrobial misuse giving rise to antimicrobial-resistant infectiousneurotropic organisms and increased susceptibility to infection related to theexpanded use of immunomodulatory treatments. In this article, we will review key concepts around emerging and re-emerging pathogens and discuss factors associatedwith neurotropism and neuroinvasion. We highlight several neurotropic pathogensof interest, including West Nile virus (WNV), Zika Virus, Japanese EncephalitisVirus (JEV), and Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV). We emphasizeneuroinfectious diseases which impact the central nervous system (CNS) and focus on flaviviruses, a group of vector-borne pathogens that have expanded globally inrecent years and have proven capable of widespread outbreak.

TI  - "No Regrets" Purchasing in a pandemic: making the most of advance purchaseagreements.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s12992-022-00851-3 [doi]
AB  - "No regrets" buying - using Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) - hascharacterized the response to recent pandemics such as Avian flu, Zika Virus, andnow COVID-19. APAs are used to reduce demand uncertainty for product developersand manufacturers; to hedge against R&D and manufacturing risks; and to secureavailability of products in the face of spiking demand. Evidence on the use ofAPAs to buy vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and personal protective equipmentduring recent pandemics illustrates how these contracts can achieve theirintended objectives for buyers. But, transferring risk from suppliers to buyers -as APAs do - can have consequences, including overbuying and overpaying.Furthermore, the widespread use of APAs by high-income countries has contributed to the striking inequities that have characterized the Swine flu and COVID-19responses, delaying access to vaccines and other supplies for low- andmiddle-income countries (L&MICs).We identify seven ways to address some of therisks and disadvantages of APAs, including adoption of a global frameworkgoverning how countries enter into APAs and share any resulting supplies;voluntary pooling through joint or coordinated APAs; aconcessional-capital-backed facility to allow international buyers and L&MICs to place options on products as an alternative to full purchase commitments; greatercollection and sharing of market information to help buyers place smarter APAs;support for a resale market; building in mechanisms for donation from the outset;and transitioning away from APAs as markets mature. While a binding globalframework could in theory prevent the competitive buying and hoarding that havecharacterized country/state responses to pandemics, it will be very challengingto put in place. The other solutions, while less sweeping, can nonethelessmitigate both the inequities associated with the current uncoordinated use ofAPAs and also some of the risks to individual buyers.Analysis of recentexperiences can provide useful lessons on APAs for the next pandemic. It will be important to keep in mind, however, that these contractual instruments work bytransferring risk to the buyer, and that buyers must therefore accept theconsequences. In the spirit of "no regrets" purchasing, having bought whathindsight suggests was too much is generally preferable to having bought notenough.

AB  - Replication-deficient adenoviral vectors have been under investigation as aplatform technology for vaccine development for several years and have recentlybeen successfully deployed as an effective COVID-19 counter measure. Areplication-deficient adenoviral vector based on the simian adenovirus type Y25and named ChAdOx1 has been evaluated in several clinical trials since 2012. TheBrighton Collaboration Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy(BRAVATO) was formed to evaluate the safety and other key features of newplatform technology vaccines. This manuscript reviews key features of theChAdOx1-vectored vaccines. The simian adenovirus Y25 was chosen as a strategy to circumvent pre-existing immunity to common human adenovirus serotypes which couldimpair immune responses induced by adenoviral vectored vaccines. Deletion of the E1 gene renders the ChAdOx1 vector replication incompetent and further geneticengineering of the E3 and E4 genes allows for increased insertional capabilityand optimizes vaccine manufacturing processes. ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines can bemanufactured in E1 complementing cell lines at scale and are thermostable. Thefirst ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines approved for human use, against SARS-CoV-2,received emergency use authorization in the UK on 30th December 2020, and is now approved in more than 180 countries. Safety data were compiled from phase I-IIIclinical trials of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines expressing different antigens(influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, meningococcal B, prostate cancer, MERS-CoV,Chikungunya, Zika and SARS-CoV-2), conducted by the University of Oxford, as wellas post marketing surveillance data for the COVID-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Overall, ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines have been well tolerated. Very rarely,thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), capillary leak syndrome (CLS),immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have beenreported following mass administration of the COVID-19 Oxford-AstraZenecavaccine. The benefits of this COVID-19 vaccination have outweighed the risks ofserious adverse events in most settings, especially with mitigation of risks whenpossible. Extensive immunogenicity clinical evaluation of ChAdOx1 vectoredvaccines reveal strong, durable humoral and cellular immune responses to date;studies to refine the COVID-19 protection (e.g., via homologous/heterologousbooster, fractional dose) are also underway. New prophylactic and therapeuticvaccines based on the ChAdOx1 vector are currently undergoing pre-clinical andclinical assessment, including vaccines against viral hemorrhagic fevers, Nipahvirus, HIV, Hepatitis B, amongst others.

AB  - As a member of vector-borne viruses, Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause microcephaly andvarious neurological symptoms in newborns. Previously, we found that ZIKV couldinfect hypothalamus, causing a decrease in growth hormone (GH) secretion, growth delay and deficits in learning and memory in suckling mice. Early administration of GH can improve the cognitive function of the mice. Therefore, in this study wefurther investigated the mechanism underlying the protective role of GH in ZIKVinfection in suckling mice. Our results showed that GH could effectively reducebrain damage caused by ZIKV infection via reducing cell apoptosis andinflammatory response rather than inhibiting viral replication. Our resultsprovide important evidences not only for understanding the mechanism underlyingZIKV-associated neurological symptoms but also for the treatment of ZIKVinfection.

AB  - Congenital alterations in the levels of the transcription factor Forkhead box g1 (FOXG1) coding gene trigger "FOXG1 syndrome," a spectrum that recapitulates birthdefects found in the "congenital Zika syndrome," such as microcephaly and otherneurodevelopmental conditions. Here, we report that Zika virus (ZIKV) infectionalters FOXG1 nuclear localization and causes its downregulation, thus impairingexpression of genes involved in cell replication and apoptosis in several cellmodels, including human neural progenitor cells. Growth factors, such as EGF and FGF2, and Thr271 residue located in FOXG1 AKT domain, take part in the nucleardisplacement and apoptosis protection, respectively. Finally, by progressivedeletion of FOXG1 sequence, we identify the C-terminus and the residues 428-481as critical domains. Collectively, our data suggest a causal mechanism by whichZIKV affects FOXG1, its target genes, cell cycle progression, and survival ofhuman neural progenitors, thus contributing to microcephaly.

AB  - Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that have been recentlyconsidered among the significant public health problems in defined geographicalregions. In this line, there have been vaccines approved for some flavivirusesincluding dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fevervirus (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), although the efficiency ofsuch vaccines thought to be questionable. Surprisingly, there are no effectivevaccine for many other hazardous flaviviruses, including West Nile and Zikaviruses. Furthermore, in spite of approved vaccines for some flaviviruses, forexample DENV, alternative prophylactic vaccines seem to be still needed for theprotection of a broader population, and it originates from the unsatisfyingsafety, and the efficacy of vaccines that have been introduced. Thus, adenovirus vector-based vaccine candidates are suggested to be effective, safe, andreliable. Interestingly, recent widespread use of adenovirus vector-basedvaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the importance andfeasibility of their widespread application. In this review, the applicability ofadenovirus vector-based vaccines, as promising approaches to harness the diseasescaused by Flaviviruses, is discussed.

TI  - Socioeconomic disparities associated with symptomatic Zika virus infections inpregnancy and congenital microcephaly: A spatiotemporal analysis from Goiania,Brazil (2016 to 2020).
PG  - e0010457
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010457 [doi]
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, which was followed by an unprecedented outbreakof congenital microcephaly, emerged in Brazil unevenly, with apparent pockets of susceptibility. The present study aimed to detect high-risk areas for ZIKVinfection and microcephaly in Goiania, a large city of 1.5 million inhabitants inCentral-West Brazil. Using geocoded surveillance data from the BrazilianInformation System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) and from the Public HealthEvent Registry (RESP-microcefalia), we analyzed the spatiotemporal distributionand socioeconomic indicators of laboratory confirmed (RT-PCR and/or anti-ZIKV IgMELISA) symptomatic ZIKV infections among pregnant women and clinically confirmed microcephaly in neonates, from 2016 to 2020. We investigated temporal patterns byestimating the risk of symptomatic maternal ZIKV infections and microcephaly per 1000 live births per month. We examined the spatial distribution of maternal ZIKVinfections and microcephaly cases across the 63 subdistricts of Goiania bymanually plotting the geographical coordinates. We used spatial scan statisticsestimated by discrete Poisson models to detect high clusters of maternal ZIKVinfection and microcephaly and compared the distributions by socioeconomicindicators measured at the subdistrict level. In total, 382 lab-confirmed casesof maternal ZIKV infections, and 31 cases of microcephaly were registered in the city of Goiania. More than 90% of maternal cases were reported between 2016 and2017. The highest incidence of ZIKV cases among pregnant women occurred betweenFebruary and April 2016. A similar pattern was observed in the following year,although with a lower number of cases, indicating seasonality for ZIKV infection,during the local rainy season. Most congenital microcephaly cases occurred with atime-lag of 6 to 7 months after the peak of maternal ZIKV infection. The highest estimated incidence of maternal ZIKV infections and microcephaly were 39.3 and2.5 cases per 1000 livebirths, respectively. Districts with better socioeconomic indicators and with higher proportions of self-identified white inhabitants were associated with lower risks of maternal ZIKV infection. Overall, the findingsindicate heterogeneity in the spatiotemporal patterns of maternal ZIKV infectionsand microcephaly, which were correlated with seasonality and included a high-riskgeographic cluster. Our findings identified geographically and socio-economicallyunderprivileged groups that would benefit from targeted interventions to reduceexposure to vector-borne infections.

TI  - Zika virus vertical transmission in mosquitoes: A less understood mechanism.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.4103/0972-9062.331411 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus disease is a great concern in different parts of the world, and it hasbecome a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The global pandemic ofZIKV in 2015 prompted concern among scientific community. Zika is a flavivirus ofthe family Flaviviridae transmitted by mosquitoes. Natural vertical transmission is an ecological strategy that arboviruses adopt to ensure their survival inside the mosquito vector during harsh conditions or interepidemic periods whenhorizontal transmission is difficult. ZIKV is vertically transmitted frominfected females to its offspring. This review has concluded various studiesregarding the vertical transmission ability of different mosquito species forZIKV. Previously Aedes aegypti was considered to be a major vector, however Aedesalbopictus and Culex quinquifasciatus are discovered to have the similar verticaltransmission potential. Different studies shown that natural verticaltransmission has been detected in mosquito species which are not implicated aspossible vectors. It leads to the possibility that many other mosquito speciesmay be potential ZIKV vectors.

TI  - A gossypol derivative effectively protects against Zika and dengue virusinfection without toxicity.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01344-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) cause microcephaly anddengue hemorrhagic fever, respectively, leading to severe problems. No effective antiviral agents are approved against infections of these flaviviruses, callingfor the need to develop potent therapeutics. We previously identified gossypol asan effective inhibitor against ZIKV and DENV infections, but this compound istoxic and not suitable for in vivo treatment. RESULTS: In this study, we showedthat gossypol derivative ST087010 exhibited potent and broad-spectrum in vitroinhibitory activity against infections of at least ten ZIKV strains isolated fromdifferent hosts, time periods, and countries, as well as DENV-1-4 serotypes, and significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared to gossypol. It presentedbroad-spectrum in vivo protective efficacy, protecting ZIKV-infected Ifnar1(-/-) mice from lethal challenge, with increased survival and reduced weight loss.Ifnar1(-/-) mice treated with this gossypol derivative decreased viral titers in various tissues, including the brain and testis, after infection with ZIKV atdifferent human isolates. Moreover, ST087010 potently blocked ZIKV verticaltransmission in pregnant Ifnar1(-/-) mice, preventing ZIKV-caused fetal death,and it was safe for pregnant mice and their pups. It also protectedDENV-2-challenged Ifnar1(-/-) mice against viral replication by reducing theviral titers in the brain, kidney, heart, and sera. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ourdata indicate the potential for further development of this gossypol derivativeas an effective and safe broad-spectrum therapeutic agent to treat ZIKV and DENV diseases.

LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220610211441 [doi]
AB  - Sulfur and oxygen containing-compounds are a relevant class of derivatives thatis constantly growing due to their wide range of pharmacological activity,including the antiviral one. As a proof of this, there are several FDA approvedantiviral compounds having sulfur and oxygen in their structures. Among RNAviruses, the flavivirus genus (e.g. Dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever and Zikaviruses) holds a relevant place within zoonotic pathogens and thus flavivirusinfections are considered a growing risk for the public health. As a consequence,the drug discovery process aimed at identify new anti-flavivirus agents is ofgreat relevance and will help to find effective therapies not available yet. One of the most alarming features of flaviviruses is their ability to co-infect thehost, thus aggravating the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, finding compounds endowed with a broad-spectrum anti-flavivirus activity is now becoming a pressingneed. In this review, we describe the most promising compounds having both sulfurand oxygen in their structures characterized by a broad-spectrum activity againstdifferent flaviviruses. Furthermore, the synthetic procedures applied for thepreparation of the described derivatives are also reported. Readers can beinspired by the contents of this review to design and synthesize more effectiveanti-flavivirus agents as well as to select viral or host targets to achieve anantiviral activity as broad as possible.

TI  - Olfactory outcomes in Zika virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome.
PG  - 2823-2831
LID - 10.1111/ene.15444 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated withGuillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). However, little is known about the consequence of ZIKV infection on olfaction in humans. METHODS: Immediately before the COVID-19outbreak, we prospectively investigated the olfactory capacities of 19 patientswith ZIKV-associated GBS from the French West Indies and compared them to ninecontrols from the same population, with GBS of similar severity but independentof ZIKV infection. To provide further evidence that ZIKV infection induces smell alteration, we investigated the consequences of ZIKV infection on olfactoryabilities using a mouse model. RESULTS: Patients with GBS-ZIKA+ had poorerolfactory function than GBS-non-ZIKA, even 1-2 years after the acute phase. Theproportion of patients with hyposmia was significantly higher in the GBS-ZIKA+than in the GBS-non-ZIKA group (68.4% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.042). These deficits were characterized by lower threshold and identification scores and were independentfrom GBS severity. Additionally, ZIKV infection was found to impair olfaction in immunodeficient mice infected with ZIKV. High viral load was observed in theirolfactory system and downstream brain structures. ZIKV promoted both cellulardamage in the olfactory neuroepithelium and protracted inflammation of theolfactory bulb, likely accounting for smell alteration. CONCLUSIONS: Patientswith ZIKV-related GBS had poorer long-term olfactory function than patients with GBS-non-ZIKA, and ZIKV-infected mice are hyposmic. These observations suggestthat ZIKV belongs on the list of viruses affecting the olfactory system. Clinicalevaluation of the olfactory system should be considered for ZIKV-infectedpatients.

TI  - Risk factors for infection with chikungunya and Zika viruses in southern PuertoRico: A community-based cross-sectional seroprevalence survey.
PG  - e0010416
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010416 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused a large outbreak in Puerto Rico in 2014,followed by a Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in 2016. Communities Organized for thePrevention of Arboviruses (COPA) is a cohort study in southern Puerto Rico,initiated in 2018 to measure arboviral disease risk and provide a platform toevaluate interventions. To identify risk factors for infection, we assessedprevalence of previous CHIKV infection and recent ZIKV and DENV infection in across-sectional study among COPA participants. Participants aged 1-50 years (y)were recruited from randomly selected households in study clusters. Eachparticipant completed an interview and provided a blood specimen, which wastested by anti-CHIKV IgG ELISA assay and anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV IgM MAC-ELISAassays. We assessed individual, household, and community factors associated with a positive result for CHIKV or ZIKV after adjusting for confounders. During2018-2019, 4,090 participants were enrolled; 61% were female and median age was28y (interquartile range [IQR]: 16-41). Among 4,035 participants tested forCHIKV, 1,268 (31.4%) had evidence of previous infection. CHIKV infectionprevalence was lower among children 1-10 years old compared to people 11 andolder (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.30; 95% CI 1.71-3.08). Lower CHIKV infectionprevalence was associated with home screens (aOR 0.51; 95% CI 0.42-0.61) and air conditioning (aOR 0.64; 95% CI 0.54-0.77). CHIKV infection prevalence also variedby study cluster of residence and insurance type. Few participants (16; 0.4%) hadevidence of recent DENV infection by IgM. Among 4,035 participants tested forZIKV, 651 (16%) had evidence of recent infection. Infection prevalence increased with older age, from 7% among 1-10y olds up to 19% among 41-50y olds (aOR 3.23;95% CI 2.16-4.84). Males had an increased risk of Zika infection prevalencecompared with females (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.09-1.57). ZIKV infection prevalencealso decreased with the presence of home screens (aOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.54-0.82) andair conditioning (aOR 0.69; 95% CI 0.57-0.84). Similar infection patterns wereobserved for recent ZIKV infection prevalence and previous CHIKV infectionprevalence by age, and the presence of screens and air conditioners in the homedecreased infection risk from both viruses by as much as 50%.

AB  - Objective: Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus(ZIKV) are several important flaviviruses, and infections caused by theseflaviviruses remain worldwide health problems. Different flaviviruses exhibitdifferent biological characteristics and pathogenicity. Metabolomics is anemerging research perspective to uncover and observe the pathogenesis of certain infections. Methods: To improve the understanding of the specific metabolicchanges that occur during infection with different flaviviruses, considering the principle of noninvasive sampling, this article describes our comprehensiveanalysis of metabolites in urine samples from the three kinds offlavivirus-infected mice using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometrymethod to better understand their infection mechanisms. Results: The urine ofDENV-, JEV-, and ZIKV-infected mice had 68, 64, and 47 different differentialmetabolites, respectively, compared with the urine of control mice. Among themetabolic pathways designed by these metabolites, ABC transporters, arginine and proline metabolism, and regulation of lipolysis play an important role.Furthermore, we predicted and fitted potential relationships between metabolites and pathways. Conclusions: These virus-specific altered metabolites may beassociated with their unique biological properties and pathogenicity. Themetabolomic analysis of urine is very important for the analysis of flavivirusinfection.

AB  - The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising technique to controlmosquitoes, vectors of diseases, like dengue, chikungunya or Zika. However, itsapplication in the field is not easy, and its success hinges upon severalconstraints, one of them being that the treated area must be sufficientlyisolated to limit migration or re-invasion by mosquitoes from the outside. Inthis manuscript we study the impact of males and (fertile) females migration onSIT. We show that a critical release rate for sterile males exists for everymigration level, in the context of continuous or periodic releases. Inparticular, when (fertile) females migration is sufficiently low, then SIT can beconducted successfully using either open-loop control or closed-loop control (or a combination of both methods) when regular measurements of the wild populationare completed. Numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results arepresented and discussed. Finally, we derive a threshold value for the femalesmigration rate, when viruses are circulating, under which it is possible to lowerthe epidemiological risk in the treated area, according to the size of the human population.

TI  - Surveillance for Zika, chikungunya and dengue virus incidence and RNAemia inblood donors at four Brazilian blood centers during 2016-2019.
LID - jiac173 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Except for public health case reports, the incidence of Zika virus(ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) infection are notavailable to assess the potential blood transfusion safety threat in Brazil.METHODS: Pools of 6 donation samples (MP6) left over from HIV, HBV, and HCVnucleic acid testing were combined to create MP18 pools (3 MP6 pools). Sampleswere tested using the Grifols triplex ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV real-timetranscription mediated amplification assay to estimate prevalence of RNAemia,incidence, and to compare these results to case reports in Sao Paulo, BeloHorizonte, Recife and Rio de Janeiro, from April 2016 - June 2019. RESULTS: ZIKV,CHIKV and DENV RNAemia were found from donors who donated without overt symptoms of infection that would have led to deferral. The highest RNAemic donationprevalence was (1.2%, 95% CI 0.8-1.9) for DENV in Belo Horizonte in May 2019.Arbovirus infections varied by location, time of year, and were not alwaysaligned with annual arbovirus outbreak seasons in different regions of thecountry. CONCLUSIONS: Testing donations for arboviruses in Brazil can contribute to public health. Transfusion recipients were likely exposed to ZIKV, CHIKV, DENVviremic blood components during the study period.

AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), the most medically relevanttick-transmitted flavivirus in Eurasia, targets the host central nervous systemand frequently causes severe encephalitis. The severity of TBEV-inducedneuropathogenesis is highly cell-type specific and the exact mechanismresponsible for such differences has not been fully described yet. Thus, weperformed a comprehensive analysis of alterations in host poly-(A)/miRNA/lncRNAexpression upon TBEV infection in vitro in human primary neurons (high cytopathiceffect) and astrocytes (low cytopathic effect). Infection with severe but notmild TBEV strain resulted in a high neuronal death rate. In comparison, infectionwith either of TBEV strains in human astrocytes did not. Differential expression and splicing analyses with an in silico prediction of miRNA/mRNA/lncRNA/vd-sRNAnetworks found significant changes in inflammatory and immune response pathways, nervous system development and regulation of mitosis in TBEV Hypr-infectedneurons. Candidate mechanisms responsible for the aforementioned phenomenainclude specific regulation of host mRNA levels via differentially expressedmiRNAs/lncRNAs or vd-sRNAs mimicking endogenous miRNAs and virus-drivenmodulation of host pre-mRNA splicing. We suggest that these factors areresponsible for the observed differences in the virulence manifestation of bothTBEV strains in different cell lines. This work brings the first complex overviewof alterations in the transcriptome of human astrocytes and neurons during theinfection by two TBEV strains of different virulence. The resulting data couldserve as a starting point for further studies dealing with the mechanism ofTBEV-host interactions and the related processes of TBEV pathogenesis.

AB  - Over the last decades, an increase in the emergence or re-emergence ofarthropod-borne viruses has been observed in many regions. Viruses such asdengue, yellow fever, or zika are a threat for millions of people on differentcontinents. On the other hand, some arboviruses are still described as endemic,however, they could become more important in the near future. Additionally, thereis a group of arboviruses that, although important for animal breeding, are not adirect threat for human health. Those include, e.g., Schmallenberg, bluetongue,or African swine fever viruses. This review focuses on arboviruses and theirmajor vectors: mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, and sandflies. We discuss thecurrent knowledge on arbovirus transmission, ecology, and methods of prevention. As arboviruses are a challenge to both human and animal health, successfulprevention and control are therefore only possible through a One Healthperspective.

AB  - The mosquito's innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, andthe conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viralinfections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (Dcr2) or R2d2resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompaniedby a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), andchikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrumantiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for thedevelopment of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immunegenes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talkbetween the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenicoverexpression of Dcr2 or R2d2 resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgutmicrobiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

AB  - Arboviruses are etiological agents of various severe human diseases that place a tremendous burden on global public health and the economy; compounding this issueis the fact that effective prophylactics and therapeutics are lacking for mostarboviruses. Herein, we identified 2 bacterial lipases secreted by aChromobacterium bacterium isolated from Aedes aegypti midgut, Chromobacteriumantiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with broad-spectrum virucidal activity against mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV),Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Sindbis virus(SINV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieuthrough their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipaseactivity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivatinginfectivity. A mutation in the lipase motif of CbAE-1 fully abrogated thevirucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAEs also exert lipase-dependententomopathogenic activity in mosquitoes. The anti-arboviral and entomopathogenic properties of CbAEs render them potential candidates for the development of noveltransmission control strategies against vector-borne diseases.

AB  - Arboviral infections are an important differential diagnosis in returningtravelers with fever, muscle or joint pain and rash. Arboviruses have spreadwidely around the globe in the last decades. The most common arboviral infectionsin returning travelers from tropical and subtropical areas are dengue,chikungunya and zika. Their most important vectors, Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitospecies, have adapted to the urban environment, which enabled arboviruses toestablish urban transmission cycles. Population growth, urbanization,globalization, modern means of transportation and global warming are speeding up their spread.Laboratory confirmation of an arboviral infection can generally beobtained by direct virus detection (PCR, antigen test) in the first week ofillness; from the second week of illness serology can be used. Treatment ismostly symptomatic.Dengue fever is the most common cause of fever in returningtravelers from South-East Asia. Patients have to be educated about and observedfor warning signs of severe dengue that can rarely develop around day 5 of thedisease and is marked by a rise in hematocrit.Chikungunya mostly occurs inepidemics and is characterized by severe and often long-lastingarthritis.Preconceptional screening for zika virus infection is not recommended. Instead, travelers should delay conception for up to three months after returningfrom a zika endemic area.Dengue, chikungunya and zika vaccine development hasbeen hampered by difficulties, for example antibody-dependent-enhancement or the unpredictability of outbreaks, and up to now no vaccines for travelers have been licensed. Yet several promising vaccine candidates are currently underdevelopment.

LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02548-21 [doi]
AB  - Quick and accurate detection of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against yellowfever is essential in serodiagnosis during outbreaks for surveillance and toevaluate vaccine efficacy in population-wide studies. All of this requiresserological assays that can process a large number of samples in a highlystandardized format. Albeit being laborious, time-consuming, and limited inthroughput, the classical plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is stillconsidered the gold standard for the detection and quantification of nAbs due to its sensitivity and specificity. Here, we report the development of analternative fluorescence-based serological assay (SNT(FLUO)) with an equally highsensitivity and specificity that is fit for high-throughput testing with thepotential for automation. Finally, our novel SNT(FLUO) was cross-validated inseveral reference laboratories and against international WHO standards, showingits potential to be implemented in clinical use. SNT(FLUO) assays with similarperformance are available for the Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and dengue virusesamenable to differential diagnostics. IMPORTANCE Fast and accurate detection ofneutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against yellow fever virus (YFV) is key in yellow fever serodiagnosis, outbreak surveillance, and monitoring of vaccine efficacy.Although classical PRNT remains the gold standard for measuring YFV nAbs, thismethodology suffers from inherent limitations such as low throughput and overall high labor intensity. We present a novel fluorescence-based serum neutralization test (SNT(FLUO)) with equally high sensitivity and specificity that is fit forprocessing a large number of samples in a highly standardized manner and has the potential to be implemented for clinical use. In addition, we present SNT(FLUO)assays with similar performance for Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and dengueviruses, opening new avenues for differential diagnostics.

AB  - Bone-related complications are commonly reported following arbovirus infection.These arboviruses are known to disturb bone-remodeling and induce inflammatorybone loss via increased activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). Wepreviously showed that Zika virus (ZIKV) could disturb the function of boneforming osteoblasts, but the susceptibility of OCs to ZIKV infection is notknown. Here, we investigated the effect of ZIKV infection on osteoclastogenesisand report that infection of pre- and early OCs with ZIKV significantly reducedthe osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Interestingly, infection of pre-OCswith a low dose ZIKV infection in the presence of flavivirus cross-reactingantibodies recapitulated the phenotype observed with a high viral dose,suggesting a role for antibody-dependent enhancement in ZIKV-associated bonepathology. In conclusion, we have characterized a primary in vitro model to studythe role of osteoclastogenesis in ZIKV pathogenesis, which will help to identify possible new targets for developing therapeutic and preventive measures.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses usesartificial containers around homes to undergo immature development, makinghousehold-level detection and control extremely difficult in large urban areas.Mass trapping is an emerging methodology to control container-Aedes species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus because effective traps for adult stages ofthese mosquitoes were developed recently. There are three main approaches tomass-trapping these mosquitoes: 1) Pull (attract/kill), 2) push (repel)-pull(attract/kill), and 3) pull (attract/contaminate/infect)-push (fly away).Effective mass-trapping depends on trap quality (capture efficiency, sturdiness, frequency of servicing), trap density and areal coverage, community involvement, and safety. Recent studies showed that Ae. aegypti populations can be sustainablycontrolled by mass trapping, although more area-wide studies showingeffectiveness at preventing disease are needed for all trapping systems.Cost-effectiveness studies are needed for all emerging Aedes control approaches.

AB  - Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Sincethey can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has beenintense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical targetbecause it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Beinga key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus toreprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, andWest Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysicalsimulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for differentoligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins canform both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH evenwithout the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainlycontrolling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern theirassociation. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found thateach flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile.These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders bothfor better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.

AB  - Ribavirin is an unnatural nucleoside exhibiting broad spectrum of antiviral andantitumor activities, still very widely studied particularly in a repositioningapproach. C-triazolyl nucleoside analogues of ribavirin have been synthesized, aswell as prodrugs and glycosylated or peptide conjugates to allow a betteractivity by vectorization into the liver or by facilitating uptake into thecells. The antiviral properties of all synthesized compounds have been evaluated in vitro against two important human viral pathogens belonging to theFlaviviridae family: hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). There are no therapeutic options for Zika virus, whereas those available for HCV can be still improved. Our results indicated that compound 2 carrying an N-hydroxy carboxamidefunction exhibits the most inhibitory activities against both viruses. Thiscompound moderately inhibited the propagation of HCV with an IC50 value of 49.1muM and Zika virus with an IC50 of 33.2 muM comparable to ribavirin in the Verocell line. The results suggest that compound 2 and its new derivatives may becandidates for further development of new anti-HCV and anti-ZIKV antiviral drugs.

TI  - Armigeres subalbatus is a potential vector for Zika virus but not dengue virus.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s40249-022-00990-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are closely relatedflaviviruses primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Armigeres subalbatus isan emerging and widely distributed mosquito, and ZIKV has been detected andisolated from it. However, it is not clear whether Ar. subalbatus could be avector for ZIKV and DENV or not. In this study, we investigated the infection andtransmission of Ar. subalbatus to ZIKV and DENV. METHODS: A line of Ar.subalbatus was isolated from Guangdong, China, and further identified by themitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene. The adults of Ar.subalbatus were fed with blood meal containing ZIKV or DENV-2. At 4, 7, 10, 14,and 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), the infections of ZIKV or DENV-2 in themidguts, ovaries and salivary glands were detected and quantified by RT-PCR andRT-qPCR. To assess the transmissibility, suckling mice were exposed to bites ofZIKV-infected mosquitoes, and ZIKV was detected in brain tissue by RT-qPCR andplaque assays. Furthermore, the larvae of Ar. subalbatus were reared inartificial urine containing ZIKV or DENV-2. The infection rates and viral titers of larvae and adults were analyzed by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR, and the viraldistribution in larval tissues was observed by immunohistochemistry. Chi-squaretest and one-way ANOVA analysis were used for assessing the infection rate andviral titer in varied tissues and different time points, respectively. RESULTS:Following oral inoculation, ZIKV but not DENV-2 could be detected in Ar.subalbatus midguts at 4 dpi, ovaries at 7 dpi and salivary glands at 10 dpi. The highest infection rate (IR) of ZIKV was 27.8% in midgut at 7 dpi, 9.7% in ovaryand 5.6% in salivary gland at 21 dpi. Eight days after being bitten byZIKV-positive mosquitoes, ZIKV was detected in three brain tissues out of foursuckling mice exposed to bites. ZIKV could be detected in the larvae reared inartificial urine contained ZIKV at a high concentration of 10(5) pfu/ml andvarious tissues of adults with a low infection rate (0.70-1.35%). ZIKV could beobserved in anal papillae and midgut of larvae at 4 dpi under laboratoryconditions. CONCLUSIONS: ZIKV but not DENV-2 can infect Ar. subalbatus by bloodmeal and artificial urine, and the infected mosquitoes can transmit ZIKV tosuckling mice by bite. From these findings, we can conclude that the Ar.subalbatus isolated from Guangdong province, China, is a potential vector forZIKV and should therefore be considered in vector control programs to prevent andcontrol of Zika virus disease.

AB  - Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are arboviral diseases (AVD) transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti. Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, has been endemic for dengue for over 30 years, and experienced the first joint epidemic of the three diseases between 2015-2016. They present similar symptoms and only a small proportion of cases arelaboratory-confirmed. These facts lead to potential misdiagnosis and,consequently, uncertainty in the registration of the cases. We have available thenumber of cases of each disease for the n=160 neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. Wepropose a Poisson model for the total number of cases of Aedes-borne diseasesand, conditioned on the total, we assume a multinomial model for the allocationof the number of cases of each of the diseases across the neighborhoods. Thisprovides simultaneously the estimation of the associations of the relative riskof the total cases of AVD with environmental and socioeconomic variables; and theestimation of the probability of presence of each disease as a function ofavailable covariates. Our findings suggest that a one standard deviation increasein the social development index decreases the relative risk of the total cases ofAVD by 28%. Neighborhoods with smaller proportion of green area had greater odds of having chikungunya in comparison to dengue and Zika. A one standard deviation increase in population density decreases the odds of a neighborhood having Zikainstead of dengue by 18% but increases the odds of chikungunya in comparison todengue by 18% and by 43% in comparison to Zika.

TI  - Transchromosomic bovines-derived broadly neutralizing antibodies as potentbiotherapeutics to counter important emerging viral pathogens with a specialfocus on SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, HIV-1, and influenza A virus.

AB  - Historically, passive immunotherapy is an approved approach for protecting andtreating humans against various diseases when other alternative therapeuticoptions are unavailable. Human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) can be made fromconvalescent human donor serum, although it is considered limited due topandemics and the urgent requirement. Additionally, polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) could be generated from animals, but they may cause severe immunoreactivity and, once "humanized," may have lower neutralization efficiency. Transchromosomicbovines (TcBs) have been developed to address these concerns by creating robustneutralizing hpAbs, which are useful in preventing and/or curing human infectionsin response to hyperimmunization with vaccines holding adjuvants and/or immunestimulators over an extensive period. Unlike other animal-derived pAbs, potenthpAbs could be promptly produced from TcB in large amounts to assist against anoutbreak scenario. Some of these highly efficacious TcB-derived antibodies havealready neutralized and blocked diseases in clinical studies. Severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has numerous variants classified into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring. Although these variants possess different mutations, such as N501Y,E484K, K417N, K417T, L452R, T478K, and P681R, SAB-185 has shown broadneutralizing activity against VOCs, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, andOmicron variants, and VOIs, such as Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda variants.This article highlights recent developments in the field of bovine-derivedbiotherapeutics, which are seen as a practical platform for developing safe andeffective antivirals with broad activity, particularly considering emerging viralinfections such as SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavirus, Zika, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and influenza A virus.Antibodies in the bovine serum or colostrum, which have been proved to be moreprotective than their human counterparts, are also reviewed.

AB  - Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is widely used to quantify viral RNA genomes for diagnostics and research, yet conventionalRT-qPCR protocols are unable to accurately distinguish between the differentviral RNA species that exist during infection. Here we show that false-primingand self-priming occur during reverse transcription with several published Zikavirus (ZIKV) primer sets. We developed a RT-qPCR assay using tagged primers andthermostable reverse transcriptase, which greatly reduced the occurrence ofnonspecific cDNA products. Furthermore, we optimized the assay for use inmultiplex qPCR which allows for simultaneous quantitative detection ofpositive-strand and negative-strand ZIKV RNA along with an internal control from both human and mosquito cells. Importantly, this assay is sensitive enough tostudy early stages of virus infection in vitro. Strikingly, using this assay, we detected ZIKV negative-strand RNA as early as 3 h post-infection in mammaliancell culture, at a time point prior to the onset of positive-strand RNAsynthesis. Overall, the strand-specific RT-qPCR assay developed herein is avaluable tool to quantify ZIKV RNA and to study viral replication dynamics duringinfection. The application of these findings has the potential to increaseaccuracy of RNA detection methods for a variety of viral pathogens.

LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000003504 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the occurrence of vomiting and gastricdysmotility in dysphagic children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) andassessed possible associations of these findings with the severity of dysphagiaand the presence of tube feeding. METHODS: Forty-six children with CZS wereassessed for dysphagia, and the occurrence of vomiting, dietary volume tolerance <15 mL/kg, and feeding time per meal >30 minutes were evaluated. Gastric antrumultrasonography was used to detect the frequency of contractions and measureantral areas (at fasting and 15 minutes postprandial), from which the gastricemptying rate (GER) was calculated. Antral ultrasonography findings were comparedwith those of ten healthy controls. Vomiting and gastric motility were comparedbetween CZS patients according to the severity of dysphagia and the requirementfor tube feeding. RESULTS: Overall, 76% (35/46) of children with CZS hadmoderate-to-severe dysphagia (MSD), among whom 60% (21/35) were tube fed [MSDtube fed (MSDTF)]. Vomiting occurred in 54% (25/46) of children, whereas dietary volume intolerance and prolonged feeding time were observed in 59% (27/46) and37% (17/46), respectively, most frequently in MSDTF patients. On ultrasound, 61% (28/46) of children with CZS had no antral contractions, whereas 90% (9/10) ofcontrols did. Compared to healthy controls, GER was eight-fold lower in children with CZS and 60-fold lower in MSDTF children. CONCLUSIONS: In dysphagic children with CZS, vomiting, volume intolerance, and prolonged feeding time were frequent and possibly associated with impaired antral contraction and delayed gastricemptying, especially in cases of severe dysphagia and tube feeding.

TI  - The Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Interacts with the PutativeEpigenetic Regulator DIDO1 to Promote Flavivirus Replication in Mosquito Cells.
PG  - e0070422
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00704-22 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for viralreplication. To gain insights into NS1 functions in mosquito cells, the proteininteractome of DENV NS1 in C6/36 cells was investigated using a proximitybiotinylation system and mass spectrometry. A total of 817 mosquito targets were identified as protein-protein interacting with DENV NS1. Approximately 14% ofthem coincide with interactomes previously obtained in vertebrate cells,including the oligosaccharide transferase complex, the chaperonin containingTCP-1, vesicle localization, and ribosomal proteins. Notably, other proteinpathways not previously reported in vertebrate cells, such as epigeneticregulation and RNA silencing, were also found in the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Due to the novel and strong interactions observed for NS1 and theepigenetic regulator DIDO1 (Death-Inducer Obliterator 1), the role of DIDO1 inviral replication was further explored. Interactions between NS1 and DIDO1 werecorroborated in infected mosquito cells, by colocalization and proximity ligationassays. Silencing DIDO1 expression results in a significant reduction in DENV andZIKV replication and progeny production. Comparison of transcription analysis of mock or DENV infected cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed variations in multiplegene expression pathways, including pathways associated with DENV infection such as RNA surveillance, IMD, and Toll. These results suggest that DIDO1 is a hostfactor involved in the negative modulation of the antiviral response necessaryfor flavivirus replication in mosquito cells. Our findings uncover novelmechanisms of NS1 to promote DENV and ZIKV replication, and add to theunderstanding of NS1 as a multifunctional protein. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Dengue virus NS1 is amultifunctional protein essential for replication and modulation of innateimmunity. To gain insights into NS1 functions, the protein interactome of dengue virus NS1 in Aedes albopictus cells was investigated using a proximitybiotinylation system and mass spectrometry. Several protein pathways, notpreviously observed in vertebrate cells, such as transcription and epigeneticregulation, were found as part of the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Amongthose, DIDO1 was found to be a necessary host factor for dengue and Zika virusreplication in mosquito cells. Transcription analysis of infected mosquito cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed alterations of the IMD and Toll pathways, part of theantiviral response in mosquitoes. The results suggest that DIDO1 is a host factorinvolved in modulation of the antiviral response and necessary for flavivirusreplication.

PG  - 77
LID - 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17419.1 [doi]
AB  - Background: The 2015-16 Zika epidemic resulted in thousands of children born withcongenital Zika syndrome (CZS). In Brazil, gaps in the health system often causedparents to be left with insufficient information and support. Consequently, wedeveloped and piloted Juntos - a participatory support programme which aims toimprove knowledge, capacities and build support networks for caregivers ofchildren with CZS. Methods: Six caregiver groups received the programme betweenAugust 2017 and June 2018: three in Rio de Janeiro and three in Bahia. Weassessed the feasibility of Juntos against six of the eight areas of afeasibility framework described by Bowen et al. to consider whether Juntos 'couldwork'. These areas were: acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality,adaptation and limited efficacy. We used mixed methods including: 1) baseline andend-line questionnaires completed by all group participants; 2) in-depthinterviews with 18 participants, seven facilitators and three key stakeholders;3) participant focus group discussions after each session; 4) researchers sessionobservation; and 5) recording programme costs. Results: 37/48 (77%) enrolledfamilies completed both questionnaires. Acceptability and demand were noted ashigh, based on participant responses to interview questions, focus group feedbackand satisfaction scores. Potential for implementation and practicality were also demonstrated through interviews with facilitators and key stakeholders andanalysis of project documents. Two groups included caregivers of children withnon-Zika related developmental disabilities, showing potential for adaptability. Self-reported quality of life scores increased in caregivers between baseline andend-line, as did the dimensions of family relationships and daily activities inthe Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDS QL) Family Impact Module, showinglimited efficacy. Conclusions: The programme showed feasibility according toBowen's framework. However, further research of scale up, particularly in theareas of integration, expansion and limited efficacy are needed to ascertain ifthe programme is effective.

TI  - A systematic review to describe patterns of animal and human viral research inRwanda.
LID - ihac031 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/inthealth/ihac031 [doi]
AB  - Rwanda is located in the Central East African region where several viralpathogens with global importance were originally described, including humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, Zika, Rift Valley Fever (RVF), dengue and a long list of other neglected tropical viral pathogens. Due to many factors, this region has the potential to become a global hotspot for viral emergence. InRwanda, viral diseases are underreported and the question is whether this is due to the absence of these viruses or a lack of investigation. Like many developing countries, capabilities in Rwanda need improvement despite research effortsthroughout the years. This review describes the status of human and animal virus research in Rwanda and identifies relevant research and operational gaps. Acomprehensive search was conducted in PubMed for virus research in Rwanda: 233primary studies on viruses/viral diseases are indexed with connection to Rwanda. From 1958 to 2020, yearly publications generally increased and HIV/acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome is the most studied virus. Compared with human viruses,few studies focus on animal and/or zoonotic viruses. The occurrence of thecurrent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic showsstrengthening warning and surveillance systems is critical to efficientpreparedness and response. We recommend investment in human capacity, laboratory facilities and research to inform policy for viral surveillance in Rwanda.

AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of diseases such as dengue,Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Improving control techniques requires abetter understanding of the mosquito's life cycle, including spatial populationdynamics in endemic regions. One of the most promising techniques consists ofintroducing genetically modified male mosquitoes. Several models proposed todescribe this technique present mathematical issues or rely on numerousparameters, making their application challenging to real-world situations. Wepropose a model describing the spatial population dynamics of the Aedes aegyptiin the presence of genetically modified males. This model presents somemathematical improvements compared to the literature allowing deeper mathematicalanalysis. Moreover, this model relies on few parameters, which we show how toobtain or estimate from the literature. Through numerical simulations, weinvestigate the impacts of environmental heterogeneity, the periodicity ofgenetically modified male releases, and released genetically modified malesquantity on the population dynamics of Aedes aegypti. The main results point tothat the successful application of this vector control technique relies onreleasing more than a critical amount of modified males with a frequencyexceeding a specific critical value.

TI  - Mouse Trophoblast Cells Can Provide IFN-Based Antiviral Protection to EmbryonicStem Cells via Paracrine Signaling.
PG  - 2761-2770
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100679 [doi]
AB  - The blastocyst is the preimplantation stage embryo that consists of two majorcomponents: the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE). The ICM givesrise to the fetus and some extraembryonic tissues whereas the TE contributes todevelopment of the placenta. Previous studies have demonstrated that both humanand mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the ICM are deficient inexpressing type I IFNs in response to viral infection. In this study, weinvestigated the IFN response in mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and their invitro differentiated trophoblasts (TSC-TBs). In this study, we report that,unlike ESCs, TSCs have a functional IFN system. They can express type I IFNs inresponse to viral stimuli and express IFN-stimulated genes in response to type I IFNs. TSC-TBs have a further developed IFN system and acquired the ability toexpress specialized type III IFN-lambda. Furthermore, TSCs and TSC-TBs canprovide ESCs with antiviral activity against Chikungunya, West Nile, and Zikavirus infection, as demonstrated with a novel coculture model that simulates the temporal and spatial relationship between the ICM and the TE in a blastocyst.Taken together, our data demonstrate that mouse ESCs can respond to type I IFNsand gain IFN-based antiviral protection from TSCs and TSC-TBs via paracrinesignaling mechanisms even though they themselves are unable to express type IIFNs.

AB  - Physiological blood-tissue barriers play a critical role in separating thecirculation from immune-privileged sites and denying access to blood-borneviruses. The mechanism of virus restriction by these barriers is poorlyunderstood. We utilize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human brainmicrovascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) to study virus-blood-brain barrier (BBB)interactions. These iPSC-derived cells faithfully recapitulate a strikingdifference in in vivo neuroinvasion by two alphavirus isolates and areselectively permissive to neurotropic flaviviruses. A model of cocultured iBMECs and astrocytes exhibits high transendothelial electrical resistance and blocksnon-neurotropic flaviviruses from getting across the barrier. We find that iBMECsconstitutively express an interferon-induced gene, IFITM1, which preferentiallyrestricts the replication of non-neurotropic flaviviruses. Barrier cells fromblood-testis and blood-retinal barriers also constitutively express IFITMs thatcontribute to the viral resistance. Our application of a renewable humaniPSC-based model for studying virus-BBB interactions reveals that intrinsicimmunity at the barriers contributes to virus exclusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the urban arboviruses (dengue, zika and chikungunya)stratification methodology by the territorial receptivity Index, an instrumentfor the surveillance and control of these diseases, which considers theheterogeneity of an intra-municipal territory. METHODS: Ecological study thatuses as unit of analysis the areas covered by health centers in Belo Horizonte.For the development of a territorial receptivity index, indicators ofsocio-environmental determination of urban arboviruses were selected in order to integrate the analysis of main components. The resulting components were weightedby the analytic hierarchy process and combined via map algebra. RESULTS: Theterritorial receptivity index showed great heterogeneity of urban infrastructure conditions. The areas classified with high and very high receptivity correspondto approximately 33% of the occupied area and are mainly concentrated in theadministrative planning regions of East, Northeast, North, West, and Barreiro,especially in areas surrounding the municipality. When the density of denguecases and Aedes eggs, from 2016, were superimposed with the stratification by theindex of territorial receptivity to urban arboviruses, areas of very highreceptivity had a high density of cases and Aedes eggs - higher than thatobserved in other areas of the city, which corresponds to a very small percentageof the municipal territory (13.5%). CONCLUSION: The analyses indicate the needfor the development of adequate surveillance and control actions for eachcontext, overcoming the logic of homogeneous allocation throughout the territory.

TI  - Identification of clinical candidates against West Nile virus by activityscreening in vitro and effect evaluation in vivo.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27891 [doi]
AB  - The West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the flavivirus and is known to causeencephalitis. There is currently no specific treatment for WNV infection.Repurposing of clinically approved drugs appeared promising for rapidlyidentifying effective, safe, and readily available candidates for antiviraldrugs. Here, we screened the small-molecule compounds with anti-WNV activity from978 Food Drug Administration-approved drugs. Four compounds, includingcilnidipine, mycophenolate mofetil, nitazoxanide, and teriflunomide, were foundto efficiently abrogate WNV infection in Vero cells and human neuroblastomaSH-SY5Y cells. The four compounds also exert broad-spectrum antiviral activityagainst the Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus,tick-borne encephalitis virus, and chikungunya virus. Furthermore, nitazoxanide(a synthetic benzamide) and teriflunomide (an inhibitor of dihydroorotatedehydrogenase, DHODH) protected 20% and 40% of mice from lethal WNV challenge,respectively. Both drugs, which are orally bioavailable and have been approvedclinically for many years, may be promising therapeutics for WNV infection.Moreover, the other two DHODH inhibitors, ML390 and vidofludimus, also displayed potent activity against WNV infection in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV serotypes 1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are relatedflaviviruses that continue to be a public health concern, infecting hundreds ofmillions of people annually. The traditional live-attenuated virus vaccineapproach has been challenging for the four DENV serotypes because of the need to achieve balanced replication of four independent vaccine components. Subunitvaccines represent an alternative approach that may circumvent problems inherent with live-attenuated DENV vaccines. In mature virus particles, the envelope (E)protein forms a homodimer that covers the surface of the virus and is the majortarget of neutralizing antibodies. Many neutralizing antibodies bind toquaternary epitopes that span across both E proteins in the homodimer. Forsoluble E (sE) protein to be a viable subunit vaccine, the antigens should beeasy to produce and retain quaternary epitopes recognized by neutralizingantibodies. However, WT sE proteins are primarily monomeric at conditionsrelevant for vaccination and exhibit low expression yields. Previously, weidentified amino acid mutations that stabilize the sE homodimer from DENV2 anddramatically raise expression yields. Here, we tested whether these samemutations raise the stability of sE from other DENV serotypes and ZIKV. We showthat the mutations raise thermostability for sE from all the viruses, increaseproduction yields from 4-fold to 250-fold, stabilize the homodimer, and promotebinding to dimer-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our findings suggest thatthese sE variants could be valuable resources in the efforts to develop effectivesubunit vaccines for DENV serotypes 1 to 4 and ZIKV.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that causes severe neuropathology in newbornsand adults. There is no ZIKV-specific treatment or preventative. Therefore, it isurgent to develop safe and effective anti-ZIKV agents. Hemin, an iron-bindingporphyrin, has been authorized by FDA to treat acute porphyria since the 1970s.Here, we aim to evaluate the anti-ZIKV effect of hemin in SNB-19 cells (a humanglioma cell line) and explore the underlying mechanism based on the virus lifecycle and functions of the host cell. Our study found that hemin has a strongactivity to protect SNB-19 cells from ZIKV infection presented by decreasedexpression of viral proteins and virus yield. Meanwhile, ZIKV infection causedSTAT1/IRF1 signaling activation and induced inflammatory responses in SNB-19cells, which was relieved by hemin treatment. HO-1 has been reported to bepotently induced by hemin and play a broad-spectrum antiviral effect.Intriguingly, hemin could still exert anti-ZIKV activity upon HO-1 siRNAtreatment. Then, we conducted a time-of-addition assay, the result indicatedhemin works mainly by interfering with the virus entry process. Furtherexperiments excluded the effects of hemin on AXL-dependent viral adsorption andclathrin-mediated endocytosis processes. Subsequently, by fluorescencespectroscopy studies, intracellular fusion assay and syncytia formation assay, werevealed that hemin acts on the process of virus-endosome fusion. This studyelaborated that hemin could play anti-ZIKV activity by disrupting thevirus-endosome fusion process and shed new light on developing novel agentsagainst ZIKV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus infection is commonly described as a mild andself-limiting illness. However, cardiac complications were associated with acute Zika virus infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old woman without previouscomorbidities with a 1-day history of symptoms tested positive for ZIKV by realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). She was admitted two days after with clinical worsening, cardiac enzymes elevated, and cardiacimaging findings, and the diagnosis of myopericarditis was made. The patient was treated and presented significant clinical improvement after one year.CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac complication following ZIKV infection appears to beinfrequent. Here, we report a rare case of viral myopericarditis caused by ZIKVinfection.

AB  - Viruses, being intracellular obligate parasites, can cause several congenital andsexually transmitted diseases. Depending on the site of infection, viruses canadopt various pathogenic mechanisms for their survival and to escape the hostimmune response. The male reproductive system is one of the attainable targets ofmany viruses including immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika virus (ZIKV),adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and infection with such viruses may cause serioushealth issues. Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules are the prime sites ofmammalian testis for viral infection. The azoospermic condition is a commonsymptom of viral infection, wherein the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT)axis can be disrupted, leading to decreased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH).Furthermore, oxidative stress (OS) is a major contributing factor to viralinfection-associated male infertility. The likelihood of direct and indirectinfection, as well as sex-based variability in the vulnerability pattern to viralinfections, has been observed. However, there appears to be a long-term impact ofviral infection on male reproductive performance due to testicular tissuepathogenicity - a process that requires thorough investigation. The present studyaimed to explore how the viruses affect the male reproductive system, includingtheir distribution in tissues and body fluids, possible targets as well as theeffects on the endocrine system. We used the major electronic databases such asMEDLINE and SCOPUS. Google Scholar was also consulted for additional literaturesearch related to the topic. Obtained literatures were sorted based on thecontent. The articles that reported the pathogenesis of viruses on malereproductive health and were published in the English language were included inthe present study.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is one of the world's most dangerous mosquitoes, and a vector ofdiseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya virus, yellow fever, and Zika virusdisease. Currently, a major global challenge is the scarcity of antiviralmedicine and vaccine for arboviruses. Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis(Bti) toxins are used as biological mosquito control agents. Endotoxins,including Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry10Aa, Cry11Aa, and Cyt1Aa, are toxic to mosquitoes. Insect eradication by Cry toxin relies primarily on the interaction of cry toxinswith key toxin receptors, such as aminopeptidase (APN), alkaline phosphatase(ALP), cadherin (CAD), and ATP-binding cassette transporters. The carbohydraterecognition domains (CRDs) of lectins and domains II and III of Cry toxins share similar structural folds, suggesting that midgut proteins, such as C-type lectins(CTLs), may interfere with interactions among Cry toxins and receptors by bindingto both and alter Cry toxicity. In the present review, we summarize thefunctional role of C-type lectins in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and the mechanismunderlying the alteration of Cry toxin activity by CTLs. Furthermore, we outline future research directions on elucidating the Bti resistance mechanism. Thisstudy provides a basis for understanding Bti resistance, which can be used todevelop novel insecticides.

LID - 10.3390/v14051101 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) and zika virus (ZIKV) infections constitute a global health emergency. Antivirals directly targeting the virus infectious cycleare still needed to prevent dengue hemorrhagic fever and congenital zikasyndrome. In the present study, we demonstrated that Cranberry Pomace (CP)extract, a polyphenol-rich agrifood byproduct recovered following cranberry juiceextraction, blocks DENV and ZIKV infection in human Huh7.5 and A549 cell lines,respectively, in non-cytotoxic concentrations. Our virological assays identified CP extract as a potential inhibitor of virus entry into the host-cell by actingdirectly on viral particles, thus preventing their attachment to the cellsurface. At effective antiviral doses, CP extract proved safe and tolerable in a zebrafish model. In conclusion, polyphenol-rich agrifood byproducts such as berryextracts are a promising source of safe and naturally derived nutraceuticalantivirals that target medically important pathogens.

TI  - Increased Serum Levels of Growth-Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) andInflammasome-Related Markers in Pregnant Women during Acute Zika Virus Infection.
LID - 1004 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051004 [doi]
AB  - The systemic inflammatory response elicited by acute Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy plays a key role in the clinical outcomes in mothers andcongenitally infected offspring. The present study aimed to evaluate the serumlevels of GDF-3 and inflammasome-related markers in pregnant women during acuteZIKV infection. Serum samples from pregnant (n = 18) and non-pregnant (n = 22)women with acute ZIKV infection were assessed for NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, andGDF3 markers through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ZIKV-negative pregnant(n = 18) and non-pregnant women (n = 15) were used as control groups. All serummarkers were highly elevated in the ZIKV-infected groups in comparison withcontrol groups (p &lt; 0.0001). Among the ZIKV-infected groups, the serum markerswere significantly augmented in the pregnant women in comparison withnon-pregnant women (NLRP3 p &lt; 0.001; IL-1beta, IL-18, and GDF3 p &lt; 0.0001).The IL-18 marker was found at significantly higher levels (p &lt; 0.05) in thethird trimester of pregnancy. Bivariate and multivariate analyses showed a strongpositive correlation between GDF3 and NLRP3 markers among ZIKV-infected pregnant women (r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.0001). The findings indicated that acute ZIKV infectionduring pregnancy induces the overexpression of GDF-3 and inflammasome-relatedmarkers, which may contribute to congenital disorders and harmful pregnancyoutcomes.

TI  - Flavivirus Capsid Proteins Inhibit the Interferon Response.
LID - 968 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050968 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) establishes persistent infections in multiple human tissues, a phenomenon that likely plays a role in its ability to cause congenital birthdefects and neurological disease. Multiple nonstructural proteins encoded byZIKV, in particular NS5, are known to suppress the interferon (IFN) response byattacking different steps in this critical antiviral pathway. Less well known arethe potential roles of structural proteins in affecting the host immune response during ZIKV infection. Capsid proteins of flaviviruses are of particular interestbecause a pool of these viral proteins is targeted to the nuclei during infectionand, as such, they have the potential to affect host cell gene expression. Inthis study, RNA-seq analyses revealed that capsid proteins from six differentflaviviruses suppress expression of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes.Subsequent interactome and in vitro ubiquitination assays showed that ZIKV capsidprotein binds to and prevents activating ubiquitination of RIG-I CARD domains by TRIM25, a host factor that is important for the induction arm of the IFNresponse. The other flavivirus capsid proteins also interacted with TRIM25,suggesting that these viral proteins may attenuate antiviral signaling pathwaysat very early stages of infection, potentially even before nonstructural proteinsare produced.

AB  - Little is known about the impact of congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure ongrowth in the first years of life. In this prospective cohort study,201 ZIKVantenatally-exposed children were followed at a tertiary referral center in Riode Janeiro, Brazil. Eighty-seven were classified as congenital Zika syndrome(CZS) patients and 114 as not congenital Zika syndrome (NCZS); growth parameters were described and compared between groups and with WHO standard growth curves.Thirty-four (39%) newborns with CZS and seven (6%) NCZS were small forgestational age (p &lt; 0.001). NCZS mean weight measures ranged from -0.45 +/-0.1 to 0.27 +/- 0.2 standard deviations (SD) from the WHO growth curve medianduring follow-up, versus -1.84 +/- 0.2 to -2.15 +/- 0.2 SD for the CZS group (p&lt; 0.001). Length mean z-scores varied from -0.3 +/- 0.1 at 1 month to 0.17 +/-0.2 SD between 31 and 36 months in the NCZS group, versus -2.3 +/- 0.3 to -2.0+/- 0.17 SD in the CZS group (p &lt; 0.001). Weight/height (W/H) and BMI z-scoresreached -1.45 +/- 0.2 SD in CZS patients between 31 and 36 months, versus 0.23+/- 0.2 SD in the NCZS group (p &lt; 0.01). Between 25 and 36 months of age, morethan 50% of the 70 evaluated CZS children were below weight and height limits; 36(37.1%) were below the W/H cut-off. Gastrostomy was performed in 23 (26%)children with CZS. During the first three years of life, CZS patients had severe and early growth deficits, while growth of NCZS children was normal by WHOstandards.

TI  - Excretion of Cell-Free and Cell-Associated Zika Virus into Breast Milk ofInfected Dams and Identification of Antiviral Factors.
LID - 851 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050851 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genusof the Flaviviridae family. During the 60 years following its discovery in 1947, ZIKV caused little concern for public health as the associated infection wasreported as mostly asymptomatic or inducing mild symptoms. However, since 2013,severe neurological symptoms have been associated with ZIKV infection, compellingthe World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency ofInternational Concern. Among those symptoms, neurological birth defects mayaffect children born to mothers infected during pregnancy. Additionally, duringthe past 8 years, ZIKV transmission through breastfeeding has repeatedly beensuggested in epidemiological studies and demonstrated on a mouse model by ourteam. To better understand the biological factors controlling ZIKV transmissionthrough breastfeeding, we investigated the nature of the viral entities excreted in the breast milk of infected dams and evaluated viral transmission to breastfedpups. We show that both cell-free and cell-associated virus is excreted intobreast milk and that ZIKV is efficiently transmitted to the breastfed pups.Additionally, we studied murine breast milk cell types, and identified a majorityof mammary luminal cells. Finally, we investigated the effect on ZIKV infectivityof several breast milk components that are antiviral against different virusessuch as lactoferrin (LF) and lactalbumin (LA), or free fatty acids (FFA). Weshowed no effect of LF and LA, whereas FFA inactivated the virus. These resultsbring new insight concerning the mechanisms of ZIKV transmission duringbreastfeeding and identify biological factors modulating it. These elementsshould be considered in risk assessment of ZIKV mother-to-child transmission.

TI  - Intranasal Immunization with Zika Virus Envelope Domain III-Flagellin FusionProtein Elicits Systemic and Mucosal Immune Responses and Protection againstSubcutaneous and Intravaginal Virus Challenges.
LID - 1014 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14051014 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in humans are mainly transmitted by the mosquitovectors, but human-to-human sexual transmission is also another important route. Developing a ZIKV mucosal vaccine that can elicit both systemic and mucosalimmune responses is of particular interest. In this study, we constructed arecombinant ZIKV envelope DIII (ZDIII) protein genetically fused with Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (FliC-ZDIII) as a novel mucosal antigen for intranasalimmunization. The results indicated that the FliC-ZDIII fusion proteinsformulated with E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTIIb-B5) adjuvantgreatly increased the ZDIII-specific IgG, IgA, and neutralizing titers in sera,and the ZDIII-specific IgA titers in bronchoalveolar lavage and vaginal fluids.Protective immunity was further assessed by subcutaneous and intravaginal ZIKVchallenges. The second-generation FliCDeltaD3-2ZDIII was shown to result in areduced titer of anti-FliC IgG antibodies in sera and still retained the samelevels of serum IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies and mucosal IgA antibodies without compromising the vaccine antigenicity. Therefore, intranasal immunizationwith FliCDeltaD3-2ZDIII fusion proteins formulated with LTIIb-B5 adjuvantelicited the greatest protective immunity against subcutaneous and intravaginalZIKV challenges. Our findings indicated that the combination ofFliCDeltaD3-2ZDIII fusion proteins and LTIIb-B5 adjuvant for intranasalimmunization can be used for developing ZIKV mucosal vaccines.

TI  - Phenotypic and Genetic Variability of Isolates of ZIKV-2016 in Brazil.
LID - 854 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10050854 [doi]
AB  - The possibility of a Zika virus epidemic resurgence requires studies tounderstand its mechanisms of pathogenicity. Here, we describe the isolation ofthe Zika virus from breast milk (Rio-BM1) and compare its genetic and virologicalproperties with two other isolates (Rio-U1 and Rio-S1) obtained during the sameepidemic period. Complete genomic analysis of these three viral isolates showedthat they carry characteristics of the American isolates and belong to the Asian genotype. Furthermore, we detected eight non-synonymous single nucleotidevariants and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms that reflect phenotypic changes.The new isolate, Rio-BM1, showed the lowest replication rates in mammalian cells,induced lower cell death rates, was more susceptible to treatment with type IIFN, and was less pathogenic than Rio-U1 in a murine model. In conclusion, thepresent study shows evidence that the isolate Rio-BM1 is more attenuated thanRio-U1, probably due to the impact of genetic alterations in the modulation ofvirulence. The results obtained in our in vitro model were consistent with thepathogenicity observed in the animal model, indicating that this method can beused to assess the virulence level of other isolates or to predict thepathogenicity of reverse genetic constructs containing other polymorphisms.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) represents a global human health threat and it is related tosevere diseases such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and Guillain-Barresyndrome (GBS). There is no vaccine available nor specific antiviral treatment,so developing sensitive, specific, and low-cost diagnostic tests is necessary.Thus, the objective of this work was to produce the Zika virus envelope proteindomain III (ZIKV-EDIII) in Komagataella phaffii KM71H and evaluate its potential for diagnostic applications. After the K. phaffii had been transformed with thepPICZalphaA-ZIKV-EDIII vector, an SDS-PAGE and Western Blot were performed tocharacterize the recombinant protein and an ELISA to evaluate the antigenicpotential. The results show that ZIKV-EDIII was produced in the expected size,with a good purity grade and yield of 2.58 mg/L. The receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve showed 90% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity for IgM, and 93.33% sensitivity and 82.76% specificity for IgG. The ZIKV-EDIII protein wasefficiently produced in K. phaffi, and it has the potential for diagnosticapplications.

AB  - Sericin, a silk-derived non-immunogenic protein, has been used to improve cellculture performance by increasing viability, cell concentration, and promotingadherence of several cell lines. Here, we hypothesized that the properties ofsericin can enhance the amplification of flaviviruses in cell cultures. Thepropagation of flavivirus is inefficient and limits scientific research. Zikavirus (ZIKV) is an important human pathogen that has been widely studied because of its high impact on public health. There is a need to amplify Zika virus bothfor research and vaccine development. In this work, we show that sericin improvesZIKV amplification in insect (C6/36) and mammalian (Vero) cell cultures, and thatit has a cryoprotectant capacity. Supplementation of cell culture media withsericin at 80 microg/mL resulted in a significant increase of 1 log in theconcentration of ZIKV infectious particles produced from both cell lines.Furthermore, final virus yields increased between 5 and 10-fold in Vero cells andbetween 7 and 23-fold in C6/36 cells when sericin was supplemented, compared tocontrol conditions. These results show that sericin is an effective supplement toincrease ZIKV production by Vero and C6/36 cells. Additionally, sericin was asuitable cryoprotective agent, and hence an alternative to FBS and DMSO, for the cryopreservation of C6/36 cells but not for Vero cells.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever etc posesignificant burden among the infectious diseases globally, especially in tropicaland sub-tropical regions. Globalization, deforestation, urbanization, climatechange, uncontrolled population growth, inadequate waste management and poorvector-management infrastructure have all contributed to the expansion of vector habitats and subsequent increase in vector-borne diseases throughout the world.Conventional vector control methods, such as use of insecticides, havesignificant negative environmental repercussions in addition to developingresistance in vectors. Till date, a very few vaccines or antiviral therapies havebeen approved for the treatment of vector borne diseases. In this review, we havediscussed emerging molecular approaches like CRISPR (clustered regularlyinterspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas-9, sterile insect technique (SIT),release of insects carrying a dominant lethal (RIDL), Wolbachia (virustransmission blocking) and RNA interference (RNAi) to combat vector andvector-borne viruses. Due to the extensive advancements in RNAi research, aspecial focus has been given on its types, biogenesis, mechanism of action,delivery and experimental studies evaluating their application as anti-mosquitoand anti-viral agent. These technologies appear to be highly promising in termsof contributing to vector control and antiviral drug development, and hence canbe used to reduce global vector and vector-borne disease burden.

AB  - With expanding recent outbreaks and a lack of treatment options, the Zika virus(ZIKV) poses a severe health concern. The availability of ZIKV NS2B-NS3co-crystallized structures paved the way for rational drug discovery. Acomputer-aided structure-based approach was used to screen a diverse library ofcompounds against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease. The top hits were selected based onvarious binding free energy calculations followed by per-residue decompositionanalysis. The selected hits were then evaluated for their biological potentialwith ZIKV protease inhibition assay and antiviral activity. Among 26 selectedcompounds, 8 compounds showed promising activity against ZIKV protease with apercentage inhibition of greater than 25 and 3 compounds displayed approximately 50% at 10 microM, which indicates an enrichment rate of approximately 36%(threshold IC50 < 10 microM) in the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protease inhibition assay. Ofthese, only one compound (23) produced whole-cell anti-ZIKV activity, and thebinding mode of 23 was extensively analyzed through long-run molecular dynamicssimulations. The current study provides a promising starting point for thefurther development of novel compounds against ZIKV.

AB  - Can envelope glycans be targeted to stop viral pandemics? Here we address thisquestion by using molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding between 10 synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) and the 33 N-glycans most commonly found on the surfaces of enveloped viruses, including Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2. Based on association quotients derived from these simulations, we classified the SCRsas weak binders, promiscuous binders, or selective binders. The SCRs almostexclusively associate at the Man3GlcNAc2 core, which is common to all N-glycans, but the binding affinity between the SCRglycan pair depends on the noncovalentinteractions between the heterocycle rings and the glycan antennae. Systematicvariations in the glycan and SCR structures reveal relationships that could guidethe design of SCRs to attain affinity and selectivity towards a chosen envelopeglycan target. With these results, envelope glycans, which are currentlyconsidered "undruggable", could become viable targets for new therapeuticstrategies.

AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic poses a substantial threat to the public, and the development of safe and effective vaccines is a demanding challenge. In thisstudy, we constructed a kind of self-assembling nanovaccine which conferscomplete protection against ZIKV infection. The ZIKV envelop protein domain III(zEDIII) was presented on recombinant human heavy chain ferritin (rHF) to formthe zEDIII-rHF nanoparticle. Immunization of mice with zEDIII-rHF nanoparticle inthe absence of an adjuvant induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses. zEDIII-rHF vaccination conferred complete protection against lethal infectionwith ZIKV and eliminated pathological symptoms in the brain. Importantly, thezEDIII-rHF nanovaccine induced immune response did not cross-react with denguevirus-2, overcoming the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) problem that is asafety concern for ZIKV vaccine development. Our constructed zEDIII-rHFnanovaccine, with superior protective performance and avoidance of ADE, provides an effective and safe vaccine candidate against ZIKV.

AB  - Schinus molle is a medicinal plant used as an anti-inflammatory and for rheumaticpain in the traditional medicine of Peru. On the other hand, Aedes aegypti is themain vector of several tropical diseases and the transmitter of yellow fever,chikungunya, malaria, dengue, and Zika virus. In this study, the aim was toinvestigate the antioxidant activity in vitro and the insecticidal activity insilico, in the presence of the mosquito juvenile hormone-binding protein (mJHBP) from Aedes aegypti, of the essential oil from S. molle leaves. The volatilephytochemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), andthe profile antioxidants were examined by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. Theevaluation in silico was carried out on mJHBP (PDB: 5V13) with an insecticidalapproach. The results revealed that EO presented as the main volatile components to alpha-phellandrene (32.68%), D-limonene (12.59%), and beta-phellandrene(12.24%). The antioxidant activity showed values for DPPH = 11.42 +/- 0.08 mumol ET/g, ABTS = 134.88 +/- 4.37 mumol ET/g, and FRAP = 65.16 +/- 1.46 mumol ET/g.Regarding the insecticidal approach in silico, alpha-muurolene and gamma-cadinenehad the best biding energy on mJHBP (DeltaG = -9.7 kcal/mol), followed bybeta-cadinene (DeltaG = -9.5 kcal/mol). Additionally, the volatile components didnot reveal antioxidant activity, and its potential insecticidal effect would beacting on mJHBP from A. aegypti.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To relate sociodemographic and clinical aspects to the quality of lifeof mothers of children with Congenital Zika Virus Syndrome. METHOD:Cross-sectional analytical study, conducted in a rehabilitation center inGoiania, central region of Brazil. A sociodemographic and clinical profilequestionnaire and the World Health Organization Quality of Life were used. Dataanalysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney tests; Kruskal-Wallis, followed by Dunnett's Post hoc; and Spearman's correlation. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 30 mothers of children with Congenital Zika Virus Syndrome, with a mean age of30.57 +/- 6.67 years. Mothers who had a partner, leisure activity, who used a caras a means of transport and who had a child with congenital syndrome withmicrocephaly had a better quality of life (p<0,05). CONCLUSION: The quality oflife of these mothers was related to sociodemographic and clinical aspects, whichsuggests the need for more specific public policies for this population.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a family member in the Flavivirus genus, has re-emerged as aglobal public health concern. The envelope (E) proteins of flaviviruses play adual role in viral assembly and entry. To identify the key residues of E in virusentry, we generated a ZIKV trans-complemented particle (ZIKVTCP) system, in whicha subgenomic reporter replicon was packaged by trans-complementation withexpression of CprME. We performed mutagenesis studies of the loop regions thatprotrude from the surface of the virion in the E ectodomains (DI, DII, DIII).Most mutated ZIKVTCPs exhibited deficient egress. Mutations in DII and in thehinge region of DI and DIII affected prM expression. With a bioorthogonal system,photocrosslinking experiments identified crosslinked intracellular E trimers and demonstrated that egress-deficient mutants in DIII impaired E trimerization. Ofthese mutants, an E-trimerization-dead mutation D389A that nears the E-Einterface between two neighbouring spikes in the immature virion completelyabolished viral egress. Several mutations abolished ZIKVTCPs' entry, withoutseverely affecting viral egress. Further virus binding experiments demonstrated adeficiency of the mutated ZIKVTCPs in virus attachment. Strikingly, synthesizedpeptide containing residues of two mutants (268-273aa in DII) could bind to host cells and significantly compete for viral attachment and interfere with viralinfection, suggesting an important role of these resides in virus entry. Ourfindings uncovered the requirement for DIII mediated-E trimerization in viralegress, and discovered a key residue group in DII that participates in virusentry.

AB  - After the latest dengue and Zika outbreaks, the fight against mosquito vectorshas become an emerging area of research. One tool for this combat is repellents; however, these products are composed of different toxic agents. Botanicalcompounds with repellent potential are an alternative; however these compoundsare highly volatile. Thus, the present study aimed to synthesize zein-basedpolymeric nanoparticles as an efficient carrier system for the sustained release of the repellents icaridin and geraniol and evaluate the toxicity of thesenanorepellents comparing two different cell models. In vitro tests were carriedout due to current Brazilian legislation prohibiting animal testing for cosmetics(current classification of repellents). The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the nanoparticles were evaluated in 2D and co-culture cell models (A549/lungepithelium, HaCaT/keratinocytes, HT-29/intestinal epithelium, andTHP-1/peripheral blood monocytes). Cell viability by mitochondrial activity, cellmembrane integrity, damage to genetic material, and expression of genes involved in the allergic/inflammatory system were evaluated. The results of cytotoxicityevaluation showed cell viability above 70% in both cell models. No differenceswere observed in genotoxicity assessment between cells exposed to nanorepellents and controls. In contrast, gene expression analysis showed increased cytokineexpression for the emulsion compounds in 2D cell cultures compared toco-cultures. These findings open perspectives that zein-based nanorepellents havepotential applications due to the reduced toxicity observed when the compoundsare encapsulated and emerge as an alternative for arbovirus control. In addition,the study demonstrated that depending on the analysis, different results might beobserved when comparing 2D and co-culture cell models to evaluate the toxicity ofnew nanosystems.

TI  - Temephos, an organophosphate larvicide for residential use: a review of itstoxicity.
PG  - 113-124
LID - 10.1080/10408444.2022.2065967 [doi]
AB  - Temephos (O,O,O',O'-tetramethyl O,O'-thiodi-p-phenylene bis(phosphorothioate)) isa larvicide belonging to the family of organophosphate pesticides used for thecontrol of different vectors of diseases, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and dracunculiasis. The aim of this review was to discuss the available publishedinformation about temephos toxicokinetics and toxicity in mammals. Temephos isquickly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all organs, andthen it accumulates mainly in adipose tissue. It is metabolized by S-oxidation,oxidative desulfuration, and hydrolysis reactions, with the possibleparticipation of cytochrome P450 (CYP). Temephos is mainly eliminated by feces,whereas some of its metabolites are eliminated by urine. The World HealthOrganization classifies it as class III: slightly dangerous with a NOAEL(no-observed adverse effect level) of 2.3 mg/kg/day for up to 90 days in rats,based on brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. A LOAEL (lowest observableadverse effect level) of 100 mg/kg/day for up to 44 days in rats was proposedbased on cholinergic symptoms. However, some studies have shown that temephoscauses toxic effects in mammals. The inhibition of the enzymeacetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of its main demonstrated effects; however,this larvicide has also shown genotoxic effects and some adverse effects on male reproduction and fertility, as well as liver damage, even at low doses. Weperformed an extensive review through several databases of the literature abouttemephos toxicokinetics, and we recommend to revisit current assessment oftemephos with the new available data.

TI  - Gold, bonds, and epidemics: A safe haven study.
PG  - 102978
LID - 10.1016/j.frl.2022.102978 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic raised the question whether gold and sovereign bonds are a safe haven during epidemics. We study the effectiveness as safe haven during the epidemics caused by SARS, Ebola, Zika, Swine Flu, and COVID-19. To this end, thisstudy employs a DCC-GARCH model to analyze the conditional correlations betweendaily returns of S&P 500 and MSCI Emerging Markets Index with gold and the major sovereign bonds. Our results show that gold is a weak safe haven for stock marketinvestors during the epidemics, and U.S. treasuries are the safest option,followed by Japanese sovereign bonds.

AB  - Emodin is an anthraquinone derivative that is widely present in natural plantsand has a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, such as antibacterial,anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anticancer and so on. Through reviewingstudies on antiviral effect of emodin in the past decades, we found that emodinexhibits ability of inhibiting the infection and replication of more than 10viruses in vitro and in vivo, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) andtype 2 (HSV-2), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),coxsackievirus B (CVB), hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza A virus (IAV),SARS-CoV, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV), enterovirus 71(EV71), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Therefore, thisreview aims to summarize the antiviral effect of emodin, in order to providereference and hopes to support the further investigations.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases are a major public health problem. Amongst them, dengue,Zika and chikungunya illnesses are increasing their incidence and geographicalexpansion. Since vector control is the main measure to prevent these diseases,this systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of environmentalinterventions for the prevention of the transmission of these three diseases, as well as for the reduction of their burden. Experimental studies of environmental management interventions aimed at vector control were included. The outcomevariables of interest were disease burden indicators and entomologicalindicators. Of the 923 references initially retrieved, after discarding thosethat were duplicated or didn't comply with the inclusion criteria, a total of 7articles were included. All included studies carried out environmentalmanipulation interventions and only 1 carried out an environmental modificationintervention. Regarding the outcome variables, all used entomological indicators (larval or pupae indices). Of those, pupae indices are better indicators ofvector abundance. In 4 out of the 6 studies, there was a statisticallysignificant reduction of the pupae indices related to the elimination of smallcontainers, manipulation of large tanks and cleaning outdoor spaces. Theseinterventions are easy to implement and involve little resources, which acquires special importance regarding areas with limited resources. Although it is assumedthat a reduction of mosquitoes would lead to a reduction or the risk oftransmission, a little evidence proving this has been published. It would beadvisable that, in addition to entomological indicators, epidemiological,environmental and sociodemographic factors would be taken into consideration,bearing in mind that mosquito density is one of the many factors that influencethe transmission of these viruses. None of the papers included used diseaseindicators, not allowing to demonstrate if environmental interventions contributeto reduce disease burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current practice of child neurology in Latin America has beenimpacted by the waves of sociopolitical unrest that in the last decades haveswept the region. METHODS: We searched the available literature referring to the situation of child neurology in Latin America and conditions that specificallyimpact the region. RESULTS: In lower-middle-income countries, the number of childneurologists is inadequate. Child neurologists working in large public hospitals can only afford to do so on a part-time basis as these institutions arechronically underfunded. Several circumstances are particularly relevant to LatinAmerica: Spanish is the main language spoken, something that limits theopportunity to keep local child neurologists up to date. The structure of health care systems in Latin America varies significantly. Some countries havefragmented systems with inadequate capacity to offer equitable access to medical care. Latin America has been impacted by epidemics of arthropod-borne viruses:zika, chikungunya, and dengue. It stands to reason that the COVID-19 pandemicwill affect the distribution of resources for chronic neurological conditions.CONCLUSIONS: The virtual platforms such as Zoom, expanded during the COVID-19pandemic, are useful not only to improve access to care through telemedicine but also for educational purposes. Collaborative efforts to support educationalcourses and symposia in Spanish are ongoing. It is necessary to set short- andlong-term priorities to improve child neurology care in the region. Immediatepriorities should focus on improving the diagnosis of neurological conditions,making emphasis on locally available resources.

AB  - Flavivirus and enterovirus can emerge unexpectedly in human populations and causea spectrum of potentially severe diseases or even death. Since effective vaccine is currently unavailable against most of these deadly viruses, antiviral chemicaldrugs remain in urgent need. To meet this unmet demand, we developed a series of 10,10'-bis(trifluoromethyl) marinopyrrole A derivates bearing varioussubstituents at C5'-positions, which exhibited impressive in vitro activitiesagainst flaviviruses (ZIKV, DENV, YFV, JEV) and enteroviruses (EV71, CA6, CA16). The lead compound 10,10'-bis(trifluoromethyl) marinopyrrole A 3 was highlyeffective against enteroviruses EV71 and CA16 in cultured cells, but with lowinhibitory activities against flavivirus. Elaborately modified from compound 3,compounds 32 and 33 with sulfhydryl aliphatic chains were found as promising ZIKVand DENV inhibitor; pyrazine-containing compound 19 is a potent broad-spectrumflavivirus inhibitor; thiophene compound 15 exhibited prominent selectiveinhibitory effect against JEV-SA14, YFV-17D, in addition to broad-spectrumenterovirus inhibitory effect. These results thus suggest that the 5'-sulfhydryl derivates of 10,10'-bis(trifluoromethyl) marinopyrrole A may be promising leadcompounds for the development of novel anti-flavivirus and anti-enterovirusdrugs.

BTI - NTP Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Technical Report on the PrenatalDevelopment Studies of 2-((1-(4-Phenoxyphenoxy)propan-2-yl)oxy)pyridine (CASRN95737-68-1) in Sprague Dawley (Hsd:Sprague Dawley((R)) SD((R))) Rats and NewZealand White (Hra:NZW SPF) Rabbits: DART Report 07
LID - 10.22427/NTP-DART-7 [doi]
AB  - 2-((1-(4-Phenoxyphenoxy)propan-2-yl)oxy)pyridine (MPEP) is a juvenile hormonemimetic pesticide used to control a variety of insects, including tsetse flies,cockroaches, and whiteflies, and is added to potable water in Zika virus-endemic areas to control mosquitoes. It has been proposed that MPEP might contribute tothe increased incidence of microcephaly in babies born to mothers who could beconsuming MPEP in potable water. Because limited information is available aboutthe potential hazard of MPEP to pregnant women, the National Toxicology Program(NTP) conducted prenatal developmental toxicity studies of MPEP to assesspossible harm to the developing conceptus and pregnant animal. In these studies, time-mated Sprague Dawley (Hsd:Sprague Dawley((R)) SD((R))) rats and New Zealand White (Hra:NZW SPF) rabbits were administered MPEP in corn oil by gavage oncedaily from implantation on gestation day (GD) 6 (rats) or GD 7 (rabbits) to theday before expected parturition (GD 20 for rats; GD 28 for rabbits). In theprenatal developmental toxicity study in rats, fetuses were examined for evidenceof MPEP fetal toxicity. A dose range-finding study in rabbits was conducted,followed by a prenatal developmental toxicity study, to confirm the absence of a response in a second species. An assessment of maternal and fetal MPEPconcentrations following exposure demonstrated maternal-fetal transfer of MPEP inboth rats on GD 18 and rabbits on GD 28. PRENATAL DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDY INRATS: Dose selection was informed by summary data provided for marketingapproval, and an additional dose level was added to aid in dose-responsecharacterization. Groups of 25 time-mated female rats were administered 0, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 mg MPEP/kg body weight/day (mg/kg/day) in corn oil by gavageonce daily from GD 6 to GD 20. After initiation of dosing (GD 6-9), damsadministered either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day displayed similar significantlydecreased (~25%) mean body weight gains relative to vehicle control animals. Thisfinding occurred concomitantly with significantly decreased (~11%) feedconsumption in the 500 mg/kg/day group, demonstrating limited maternal toxicity. Exposure to MPEP did not affect any pregnancy or litter parameters. Fetal weight in the 500 mg/kg/day group was slightly lower (<4%), with a significant trend,and was not associated with an increased incidence of ossification variants.Fetal visceral findings included small increases in the incidences of liverdiscoloration (a variation), which could have been incidental but may be indirecteffects of MPEP on fetal liver function or metabolism. No external, visceral,head, or skeletal malformations were attributed to MPEP exposure. DOSERANGE-FINDING STUDY IN RABBITS: Groups of eight time-mated female rabbits wereadministered 0, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg/day MPEP in corn oil by gavage once daily from GD 7 to GD 28. Information from previous work indicated a likely sharpdose-response curve for maternal toxicity. Decreased feed consumption anddecreases in mean body weight indicative of overt maternal toxicity were observedat doses of 400 and 500 mg/kg/day, resulting in those dose groups being removedfrom the study and fetuses not examined. Similar, but less severe, maternalfindings were noted at 300 mg/kg/day. Uterine and fetal weights were slightlylower in the 300 mg/kg/day dose group relative to the vehicle control group, and these findings may have been secondary to maternal toxicity. No external orplacental observations were attributed to MPEP exposure. A high dose of 250mg/kg/day was therefore selected for the prenatal developmental toxicity study.PRENATAL DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDY IN RABBITS: Time-mated rabbits (23 or 24per dose group) were administered 0, 62.5, 125, or 250 mg/kg/day of MPEP in corn oil by gavage once daily from GD 7 to GD 28. An additional 3 or 4 does per dosegroup, used for biological sampling, were administered the same doses of MPEP.The 250 mg/kg/day dose was generally well tolerated by most does; however,decreases in feed consumption, mean body weight, and body weight gain wereobserved in this dose group, resulting in three animals being removed early from the study. These early removals, in addition to two nonpregnant does and two doesthat underwent parturition prior to laparotomy, collectively resulted in 16litters in the 250 mg/kg/day group available for examination. Litter size,postimplantation loss, and fetal weight were not affected by MPEP exposure,demonstrating that although the 250 mg/kg/day dose resulted in some maternaltoxicity, the does and fetuses received the highest dose possible without overtimpact on maternal function that may impact fetal outcomes. No external,visceral, or head malformations were attributed to MPEP exposure. A singleincidence of hydrocephaly was noted in one fetus in the 125 mg/kg/day group, but this finding was considered incidental. Three fetuses from two litters and three fetuses from one litter in the 125 and 250 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively,displayed increased incidences of a skeletal malformation: seventh costalcartilage not fused to sternum. This structure is recognized by the InternationalFederation of Teratology Societies but has not specifically been reported in the historical control data of commercial contract laboratories used for animalsourcing. The absence of this cartilaginous structure could result from a delayin development independent of maternal toxicity, given that individual doe meanbody weight gains and feed consumption were similar to those of does whosefetuses were not observed with this malformation. Exposure to MPEP was confirmed in pregnant rats and rabbits and MPEP was detected in the fetuses, demonstrating that fetuses were exposed to MPEP. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of the ratprenatal developmental toxicity study, there was no evidence of developmentaltoxicity of 2-((1-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)propan-2-yl)oxy)pyridine (MPEP) in SpragueDawley (Hsd:Sprague Dawley((R)) SD((R))) rats administered 62.5, 125, 250, or 500mg/kg/day based on the absence of effects on reproductive parameters, fetalweight, or increased incidence of fetal malformations or variations. The highest dose administered was 500 mg/kg/day, which did not result in overt maternaltoxicity. Under the conditions of the rabbit prenatal developmental toxicitystudy, there was equivocal evidence of developmental toxicity of MPEP in NewZealand White (Hra:NZW SPF) rabbits based on the occurrence of the malformation"seventh costal cartilage not fused to sternum" in dosed groups. This finding wasobserved at 250 mg/kg/day, a dose that induced some maternal toxicity.SYNONYMS:MPEP; MPPE; pyridine, 2-[1-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethoxy]-;2-[1-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethoxy]pyridine;2-((1-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)propan-2-yl)oxy)pyridine; pyriproxyfen TRADE NAMES: Nylar

TI  - Ultrasound-assisted nanoemulsion of Trachyspermum ammi essential oil and itsconstituent thymol on toxicity and biochemical aspect of Aedes aegypti.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20870-2 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, and dengueworldwide and is managed by using chemical insecticides. Though effective, their indiscriminate use brings in associated problems on safety to non-target and the environment. This supports the use of plant-based essential oil (EO) formulationsas they are safe to use with limited effect on non-target organisms. Quickvolatility and degradation of EO are a hurdle in its use; the present studyattempts to develop nanoemulsions (NE) of Trachyspermum ammi EO and itsconstituent thymol using Tween 80 as surfactant by ultrasonication method. The NEof EO had droplet size ranging from 65 +/- 0.7 to 83 +/- 0.09 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) value of 0.18 +/- 0.003 to 0.20 +/- 0.07 from 1 to 60 daysof storage. The NE of thymol showed a droplet size ranging from 167 +/- 1 to 230 +/- 1 nm and PDI value of 0.30 +/- 0.03 to 0.40 +/- 0.008 from 1 to 60 days ofstorage. The droplet shape of both NEs appeared spherical under a transmissionelectron microscope (TEM). The larvicidal effect of NEs of EO and thymol wasbetter than BEs (Bulk emulsion) of EO and thymol against Ae. aegypti. Among theNEs, thymol (LC50 34.89 ppm) had better larvicidal action than EO (LC50 46.73ppm). Exposure to NEs of EO and thymol causes the shrinkage of the larval cuticleand inhibited the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Ae. aegypti. Ourfindings show the enhanced effect of NEs over BEs which facilitate its use as an alternative control measure for Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Natural products as Zika antivirals.
LID - 10.1002/med.21891 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the flavivirus genus and istransmitted in Aedes mosquito vectors. Since its discovery in humans in 1952 inUganda, ZIKV has been responsible for many outbreaks in South America, Africa,and Asia. Patients infected with ZIKV are usually asymptomatic; mild symptomsinclude fever, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue. However, severe infections mayhave neurological implications, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and fetalmicrocephaly. To date, there are no existing approved therapeutic drugs orvaccines against ZIKV infections; treatments mainly target the symptoms ofinfection. Preventive measures against mosquito breeding are the main strategyfor limiting the spread of the virus. Antiviral drug research for the treatmentof ZIKV infection has been rapidly developing, with many drug candidates emergingfrom drug repurposing studies, and compound screening. In particular, severalstudies have demonstrated the potential of natural products as antivirals forZIKV infection. Hence, this paper will review recent advances in natural productsin ZIKV antiviral drug discovery.

TI  - Immunoglobulin M seroneutralization for improved confirmation of Japaneseencephalitis virus infection in a flavivirus-endemic area.
LID - trac036 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trac036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mainstay of diagnostic confirmation of acute Japaneseencephalitis (JE) involves detection of anti-JE virus (JEV) immunoglobulin M(IgM) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Limitations in thespecificity of this test are increasingly apparent with the introduction of JEVvaccinations and the endemicity of other cross-reactive flaviviruses. Virusneutralization testing (VNT) is considered the gold standard, but it ischallenging to implement and interpret. We performed a pilot study to assess IgG depletion prior to VNT for detection of anti-JEV IgM neutralizing antibodies(IgM-VNT) as compared with standard VNT. METHODS: We evaluated IgM-VNT in paired sera from anti-JEV IgM ELISA-positive patients (JE n=35) and negative controls ofhealthy flavivirus-naive (n=10) as well as confirmed dengue (n=12) and Zika virus(n=4) patient sera. IgM-VNT was subsequently performed on single sera fromadditional JE patients (n=76). RESULTS: Anti-JEV IgG was detectable in admission serum of 58% of JE patients. The positive, negative and overall percentageagreement of IgM-VNT as compared with standard VNT was 100%. A total of 12/14(86%) patient samples were unclassified by VNT and, with sufficient sampleavailable for IgG depletion and IgG ELISA confirming depletion, were classifiedby IgM-VNT. IgM-VNT enabled JE case classification in 72/76 (95%) patients forwhom only a single sample was available. CONCLUSIONS: The novel approach has beenreadily adapted for high-throughput testing of single patient samples and itholds promise for incorporation into algorithms for use in reference centres.

TI  - Evidence for serial founder events during the colonization of North America bythe yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.

AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito first invaded the Americas about 500 years ago andtoday is a widely distributed invasive species and the primary vector for virusescausing dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. Here, we test the hypothesisthat the North American colonization by Ae. aegypti occurred via a series offounder events. We present findings on genetic diversity, structure, anddemographic history using data from 70 Ae. aegypti populations in North Americathat were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci and/or ~20,000 single nucleotidepolymorphisms, the largest genetic study of the region to date. We find evidence consistent with colonization driven by serial founder effect (SFE), with Florida as the putative source for a series of westward invasions. This scenario wassupported by (1) a decrease in the genetic diversity of Ae. aegypti populationsmoving west, (2) a correlation between pairwise genetic and geographic distances,and (3) demographic analysis based on allele frequencies. A few Ae. aegyptipopulations on the west coast do not follow the general trend, likely due to arecent and distinct invasion history. We argue that SFE provides a helpful albeitsimplified model for the movement of Ae. aegypti across North America, withoutlier populations warranting further investigation.

TI  - Widespread interspecific phylogenetic tree incongruence between mosquito-borneand insect-specific flaviviruses at hotspots originally identified in Zika virus.
PG  - veac027
LID - 10.1093/ve/veac027 [doi]
AB  - Intraspecies (homologous) phylogenetic incongruence, or 'tree conflict' betweendifferent loci within the same genome of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV), was first identified in dengue virus (DENV) and subsequently in Japanese encephalitisvirus (JEV), St Louis encephalitis virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV). Recently, thefirst evidence of phylogenetic incongruence between interspecific members of the MBFV was reported in ZIKV and its close relative, Spondweni virus. Uniquely,these hybrid proteomes were derived from four incongruent trees involving anAedes-associated DENV node (1 tree) and three different Culex-associatedflavivirus nodes (3 trees). This analysis has now been extended across a widerspectrum of viruses within the MBFV lineage targeting the breakpoints betweenphylogenetic incongruent loci originally identified in ZIKV. Interspeciesphylogenetic incongruence at these breakpoints was identified in 10 of 50 viruseswithin the MBFV lineage, representing emergent Aedes and Culex-associated virusesincluding JEV, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and insect-specific viruses. Thus, interspecies phylogenetic incongruence is widespread amongst theflaviviruses and is robustly associated with the specific breakpoints thatcoincide with the interspecific phylogenetic incongruence previously identified, inferring they are 'hotspots'. The incongruence amongst the emergent MBFV groupwas restricted to viruses within their respective associated epidemiologicalboundaries. This MBFV group was RY-coded at the third codon position ('wobblecodon') to remove transition saturation. The resulting 'wobble codon' treespresented a single topology for the entire genome that lacked any robust evidenceof phylogenetic incongruence between loci. Phylogenetic interspecificincongruence was therefore observed for exactly the same loci between amino acid and the RY-coded 'wobble codon' alignments and this incongruence representedeither a major part, or the entire genomes. Maximum likelihood codon analysisrevealed positive selection for the incongruent lineages. Positive selectioncould result in the same locus producing two opposing trees. These analyses forthe clinically important MBFV suggest that robust interspecific phylogeneticincongruence resulted from amino acid selection. Convergent or parallelevolutions are evolutionary processes that would explain the observation, whilst interspecific recombination is unlikely.

PG  - 104-108
LID - 10.2987/21-7053 [doi]
AB  - It has been reported that roughly 80% of vector control organizations throughout the southern USA lack critical capabilities to properly address potential vector populations and vector-borne diseases within their jurisdictions. This studyfurther investigated current vector control capabilities and capacity within the states of Florida and Texas. It was reported that only 26% of jurisdictions inFlorida and 14% in Texas reported that they were "fully capable." Both states areamong the top 4 states relative to the number of human cases of mosquito-bornediseases, and both states have had local transmission of Zika virus. Respondents from Florida indicated that 88% of jurisdictions have vector control capabilitiesto some degree, with 65% of those reporting they had sufficient capabilities.Respondents from Texas indicated that 89% of jurisdictions have vector controlcapabilities to some degree, with 67% of those reporting they had sufficientcapabilities. As the prioritization of resource commitment for vector controlcapabilities varies throughout the USA, it is imperative that each stateevaluates their specific needs and current capabilities and capacity to bestensure the public health needs of their constituents.

AB  - The diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue, chikungunya, yellowfever, and Zika, are ever-increasing. Rapid and unplanned urbanization adversely impacts various endemic species such as ants and facilitates the breeding ofAedes mosquitoes. We have observed the predatory potential of ants over Aedeseggs in urban breeding habitats, and their impact on Aedes mosquito breeding was determined by a field experiment that mimicked the natural breeding habitats. It was found that 99.4% of eggs were removed from the experimental containers byforaging ants in 4 days. The present study demonstrates the role of ants as anatural regulator, limiting Aedes mosquito breeding.

TI  - A Cross-Sectional Household Survey in the US Virgin Islands (2019) RevealsCisterns as Challenging Peridomestic Aedes aegypti Habitats.
PG  - 113-117
LID - 10.2987/21-7022 [doi]
AB  - Most residences in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) rely on householdrainwater-catchment systems and subterranean cisterns for long-term water storagethat may provide suitable habitats for mosquitoes of public health relevance. We conducted a household cistern survey (n = 164) on the islands of St. Croix, St.John, and St. Thomas in 2019. The survey revealed that 45.7% (95% CI: 38.3-53.4%)of cisterns contained mosquitoes (adult and/or immature mosquitoes). Aedesaegypti, a vector of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses in the USVI, was foundin 27.4% (95% CI: 21.2-34.7%) of cisterns and accounted for 83.3% of the totalmosquitoes identified in the study. The odds of detecting mosquitoes in a cisternwere 5.45 times higher at locations where the residents reported that they hadobserved adult mosquitoes coming out of their cisterns (95% CI: 2.25-14.21),suggesting that vector control personnel should consider resident complaintsabout mosquitoes in their cistern as valid and likely reliable self-assessments. Resident mosquito management practices in cisterns did not correspond withdecreased odds of mosquito detection. We conclude that cisterns in the USVIcommonly provide habitat for immature and adult Ae. aegypti, which may decreasethe effectiveness of area-wide mosquito control strategies. Additional studiesare necessary to evaluate the importance of these cisterns as they relate tomosquito production and arbovirus transmission risk, and to assess physical andchemical control methods.

LID - e151782 [pii]
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits both dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus(ZIKV) . Individuals in endemic areas are at risk for infection with bothviruses, as well as for repeated DENV infection. In the presence of anti-DENVantibodies, outcomes of secondary DENV infection range from mild to lifethreatening. Furthermore, the role of cross-reactive antibodies on the course of ZIKV infection remains unclear. We assessed the ability of cross-reactive DENVmAbs or polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated after DENV vaccination to upregulatetype I IFN production by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in response to both heterotypic DENV- and ZIKV-infected cells. We found a range in the ability of antibodies toincrease pDC IFN production and a positive correlation between IFN production andthe ability of an antibody to bind to the infected cell surface. Engagement of Fcreceptors on the pDC and engagement of epitope on the infected cell by the Fabportion of the same antibody molecule was required to mediate increased IFNproduction by providing specificity to and promoting pDC sensing of DENV or ZIKV.This represents a mechanism independent of neutralization by which preexistingcross-reactive DENV antibodies could protect a subset of individuals from severe outcomes during secondary heterotypic DENV or ZIKV infection.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) suddenly evolved from a neglected arthropod-borne flavivirusinto a pandemic pathogen during 2015-2016. A panel of amino acid mutations hasbeen shown to be responsible for the enhanced neurovirulence and transmissibilityof ZIKV. Recent studies have demonstrated that ZIKV genomic RNA is modified byhost N6-methyladenosine (m(6) A) machinery during viral replication in hostcells, and the m(6) A profiles vary among different isolates and different hostcells. In the present study, using a contemporary Asian ZIKV strain isolated in2019 (SZ1901) as a model, we profiled m(6) A modifications on both the viralgenome RNA and cellular transcripts from the ZIKV-infected human hepatocarcinoma cell line Huh7. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq)identified a unique m(6) A map in the genome of ZIKV strain SZ1901 that isdifferent from all previous isolates. Meanwhile, ZIKV infection induced m(6) Aupregulation in the CDS regions but downregulation in the 3' untranslated region of host RNA transcripts. The m(6) A peak intensity in the majority of host genes was downregulated, including ISG-related genes. Overall, our study describesunique viral and host m(6) A profiles in contemporary ZIKV-infected Huh7 cells,highlighting the complexity and importance of m(6) A modification during viralinfection.

AB  - Climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughoutthe world, which is a health security threat. Climate-sensitive infectiousdisease includes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, whose transmissionpotential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability forthe mosquito vector in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Climaticsuitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya isalso likely to increase, facilitating further increases in the geographic rangeand longer transmission seasons, and raising concern for expansion of thesediseases into temperate zones, particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to theearly onset and extensive West Nile virus outbreak in Europe, a pathogen expectedto expand further beyond its current distribution, due to a warming climate. Asfor tick-borne diseases, climate change is projected to continue to contribute tothe spread of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, particularly in NorthAmerica and Europe. Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and public healthconcern in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; climatechange is anticipated to change its distribution, with both expansions andcontractions expected. Other water-borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseaseshave declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomicdevelopment and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some ofthese positive developments. Weather and climate events, population movement,land use changes, urbanization, global trade, and other drivers can catalyze asuccession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts,including infectious disease outbreaks. These cascading risk pathways of causallyconnected events can result in large-scale outbreaks and affect society at large.We review climatic and other cascading drivers of infectious disease withprojections under different climate change scenarios.

AB  - The genus Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae) includes species of great epidemiologicalrelevance, particularly involved in transmission cycles of leading arboviruses inthe Brazilian Amazon region, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We report here the firstputatively complete sequencing of the mitochondrial genomes of Brazilianpopulations of the species Aedes albopictus, Aedes scapularis and Aedes serratus.The sequences obtained showed an average length of 14,947 bp, comprising 37functional subunits, typical in animal mitochondria (13 PCGs, 22 tRNA, and 2rRNA). The phylogeny reconstructed by Maximum likelihood method, based on theconcatenated sequences of all 13 PCGs produced at least two non-directly related groupings, composed of representatives of the subgenus Ochlerotatus and Stegomyiaof the genus Aedes. The data and information produced here may be useful forfuture taxonomic and evolutionary studies of the genus Aedes, as well as theCulicidae family.

AB  - Although generating high neutralizing antibody levels is a key component ofprotective immunity after acute viral infection or vaccination, little is knownabout why some individuals generate high versus low neutralizing antibody titers.Here, we leverage the high-dimensional single-cell profiling capacity of masscytometry to characterize the longitudinal cellular immune response to Zika virus(ZIKV) infection in viremic blood donors in Puerto Rico. During acute ZIKVinfection, we identify widely coordinated responses across innate and adaptiveimmune cell lineages. High frequencies of multiple activated cell types duringacute infection are associated with high titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies 6months post-infection, while stable immune features suggesting a cytotoxic-skewedimmune set point are associated with low titers. Our study offers insight intothe coordination of immune responses and identifies candidate cellular biomarkersthat may offer predictive value in vaccine efficacy trials aimed at inducing highlevels of antiviral neutralizing antibodies.

AB  - People may cling to false facts even in the face of updated and correctinformation. The present study confronted misconceptions about the measles, mumpsand rubella vaccine and a novel, fictitious Zika vaccine. Two experiments arereported, examining misconceptions as motivated by a poor risk understanding(Experiment 1, N = 130) or the exposure to conspiracy theories (Experiment 2, N =130). Each experiment featured a Misinformation condition, wherein participantswere presented with fictitious stories containing some misinformation (Experiment1) and rumours focused on conspiracy theories (Experiment 2) that were laterretracted by public health experts and a No misinformation condition, containing no reference to misinformation and rumours. Across experiments, participants weremore hesitant towards vaccines when exposed to stories including vaccinemisinformation. Notwithstanding, our results suggest a positive impact of atrusted source communicating the scientific consensus about vaccines. Zika virus represents a particular case showing how missing information can easily evolveinto misinformation. Implications for effective dissemination of information are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe anthropometric, sensory, and neurodevelopmental outcomesof children who were Zika virus-exposed from birth to 36 months. STUDY DESIGN:The study cohort included 114 children born to mothers with confirmed andprobable Zika virus pregnancy infection in 2016-2017. Children attending studyvisits from May 2017 through February 2020 underwent physical/neurologic, sensoryexaminations, and neurodevelopmental assessments with the Bayley Scales of Infantand Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) and Ages and StagesQuestionnaires, Third Edition (ASQ-3). RESULTS: Three of the 114 children (2.6%) had microcephaly (z-score for head circumference </=-2) at birth, 19 of 35(54.3%) had posterior eye abnormalities in retinal images, and 11 of 109 (10.1%) had nonspecific findings on brain ultrasound. Three of 107 children (2.8%) failedhearing screening at birth. Of those children with follow-up data, 17 of 97(17.5%) failed age-appropriate vision screening. The BSID-III identifieddevelopmental delay in at least 1 domain in at least one-third of children, with higher prevalence in the language domain. ASQ-3 screen positive delay peaked ataround 24 or 36 months, with some domains showing a decrease at older ages.Correlations among BSID-III and ASQ-3 scores were observed, representingprofessional and parental perspectives at 24 and 36 months (r = 0.32-0.78; P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of neurodevelopmental sequelae in early childhoodsuggests that identification of long-term impairment remains critical toattaining optimal child development. Long-term follow-up highlights vulnerabilityin the language domain, which likely could be influenced by early intervention,promoting cognitive development and school readiness in exposed children.

TI  - Somatic Hypermutation and Framework Mutations of Variable Region Contribute toAnti-Zika Virus-Specific Monoclonal Antibody Binding and Function.

LID - 10.1128/jvi.00071-22 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health concern due to its ability to causecongenital Zika syndrome and lack of approved vaccine, therapeutic, or othercontrol measures. We discovered eight novel rabbit monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)that bind to distinct ZIKV envelope protein epitopes. The majority of the MAbswere ZIKV specific and targeted the lateral ridge of the envelope (E) proteindomain III, while the MAb with the highest neutralizing activity recognized aputative quaternary epitope spanning E protein domains I and III. One of thenon-neutralizing MAbs specifically recognized ZIKV precursor membrane protein(prM). Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin variable regions increasesantibody affinity maturation and triggers antibody class switching. Negativecorrelations were observed between the somatic hypermutation rate of theimmunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region and antibody binding parameters suchas equilibrium dissociation constant, dissociation constant, and half-maximaleffective concentration value of MAb binding to ZIKV virus-like particles.Complementarity-determining regions recognize the antigen epitopes and arescaffolded by canonical framework regions. Reversion of framework region aminoacids to the rabbit germ line sequence decreased anti-ZIKV MAb binding activityof some MAbs. Thus, antibody affinity maturation, including somatic hypermutationand framework region mutations, contributed to the binding and function of these anti-ZIKV MAbs. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a global health concern against which novaccine or therapeutics are available. We characterized eight novel rabbitmonoclonal antibodies recognizing ZIKV envelope and prM proteins and studied the relationship between somatic hypermutation of complementarity-determiningregions, framework regions, mutations, antibody specificity, binding, andneutralizing activity. The results contribute to understanding structuralfeatures and somatic mutation pathways by which potent Zika virus-neutralizingantibodies can evolve, including the role of antibody framework regions.

TI  - Downregulation of transcriptional activity, increased inflammation, and damage inthe placenta following in utero Zika virus infection is associated with adversepregnancy outcomes.
LID - 782906 [pii]
LID - 10.3389/fviro.2022.782906 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes serious adverse outcomes tothe developing fetus, including fetal loss and birth defects known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The mechanism by which ZIKV infection causes these adverseoutcomes and specifically, the interplay between the maternal immune response andZIKV replication has yet to be fully elucidated. Using an immunocompetent mousemodel of transplacental ZIKV transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes, we havepreviously shown that Asian lineage ZIKV disrupts placental morphology andinduces elevated secretion of IL-1beta. In the current manuscript, wecharacterized placental damage and inflammation during in utero African lineageZIKV infection. Within 48 hours after ZIKV infection at embryonic day 10, viralRNA was detected in placentas and fetuses from ZIKA infected dams, whichcorresponded with placental damage and reduced fetal viability as compared withmock infected dams. Dams infected with ZIKV had reduced proportions oftrophoblasts and endothelial cells and disrupted placental morphology compared tomock infected dams. While placental IL-1beta was increased in the placenta, butnot the spleen, within 3 hours post infection, this was not caused by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Using bulk mRNAseq from placentas of ZIKV and mockinfected dams, ZIKV infection caused profound downregulation of thetranscriptional activity of genes that may underly tissue morphology,neurological development, metabolism, cell signaling and inflammation,illustrating that in utero ZIKV infections causes disruption of pathwaysassociated with CZS in our model.

AB  - We study the effects of epidemic diseases on corporate investment. Epidemicdiseases tend to be unanticipated and exogenous to firms' decisions. Usingdifference-in-difference estimation strategy and a firm-level exposure to anepidemic disease measure, we find that corporate investment declinessignificantly following the onset of an epidemic disease. We also show that theCOVID-19 pandemic has the strongest negative impact on investment when comparedto the other most recent epidemic diseases.

TI  - Ocular findings of congenital Zika virus infection with microcephaly.
LID - 10.1007/s10792-022-02311-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe ocular findings in infants with signs of congenital Zikavirus syndrome (CZS) in Paraiba, Brazil, as well as to conduct a literaturereview and report correlations with published clinical cases. METHODS: In theParaiba sample, infants with microcephaly suggestive of CZS were classified as Z (confirmed), PZ (probable), or SZ (suspected) according to serological testingand/or clinical findings of CZS. The patients underwent a clinical eyeexamination, and the results were correlated with published clinical cases.RESULTS: Ocular findings were present in 24 (42.9%) of 56 patients, consisting ofgross retinal pigmentation in 11 (45.8%), macular chorioretinal atrophy in 11(45.8%), optic nerve hypoplasia in 1 (4.2%), optic nerve pallor in 14 (58.3%),and increased cup-to-disk ratio in 2 (8.3%). The study revealed retina and optic nerve findings consistent with previous reports of ophthalmic involvement in CZS.However, external ocular changes observed in other studies were not detected.CONCLUSION: Ocular findings similar and consistent with the literature on CZSwere observed with considerable frequency and severity, regardless of thepatients' serological confirmation or classification. Infants with signs of CZSshould undergo ocular examination.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 outbreak, millions of people have been infected withSARS-CoV-2 around the world. An area of epidemiological relevance is LatinAmerica, tropical regions, due to the distribution of endemic diseases such aschikungunya, dengue (DENV), malaria, Zika virus, where febrile disease abounds.The early signs and symptoms of DENV and COVID-19 could be similar, making it arisk that patients may be wrongly diagnosed early during the disease. The problemincreases since COVID-19 infection can lead to false positives in DENV screening tests. We present two cases of acute undifferentiated febrile syndrome that were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and DENV co-infection, confirmed by ELISA and RT-PCRfor both viral pathogens. The occurrence of simultaneous or overlapped infectionscan alter the usual clinical course, severity, or outcome of each infection.Therefore, epidemiological surveillance and intensified preparation for thosescenarios must be considered, as well as further studies should be done toaddress cases of co-infection promptly to avoid major complications and fataloutcomes during the current pandemic. Other endemic tropical diseases should not be neglected.

AB  - Infections because of chikungunya and other mosquito-borne viruses, such asdengue and Zika, represent an area of significant unmet medical need. There arecurrently no approved medicines for prophylaxis or treatment of these diseases,and the development and implementation of vaccines against these viruses haveproved problematic. Although antiviral molecules with treatment and prophylactic potential against the chikungunya virus have been identified, no successful fieldtrials have been reported. Chemoprophylaxis may be attractive for unvaccinatedat-risk populations; however, performing a successful chemoprophylaxis trialduring a chikungunya outbreak will require a clearly identifiable at-riskpopulation. We propose the application of a household transmission model as used in testing drugs against respiratory viruses. Current evidence on householdclustering of chikungunya and other Aedes mosquito-borne viral infections issupportive. We suggest that this model may improve prophylaxis trial feasibility and focus research and future treatment on a population likely to benefit.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is native to Asia and is ranked among the top 100 invasivespecies worldwide, with vector competence for dengue, Zika, and chikungunyaviruses. Understanding Ae. albopictus dispersal is essential for effectivemonitoring and vector control strategies. In this study, we analysed and updated the distribution of Ae. albopictus in Brazil using data available from theMinistry of Health through the Rapid Index Survey for Aedes (LIRA) for the years 2015-2020. The results of this research were mapped to visually represent thecurrent distribution of Ae. albopictus in Brazil. In 2015, the presence of thevector was confirmed in 271 of the 1,820 Brazilian municipalities sampled(14.9%), and in 2020 it was detected in 728 of the 2,937 municipalities sampled(24.8%). In 2020, all Brazilian states had recorded the presence of this criticalvector with a broader geographic distribution in the Southeast and Midwestregions as compared to the North, Northeast, and South regions. It was possibleto note some stabilization of dispersion of this species in the Brazilianterritory. The record of Ae. albopictus distribution advanced in Brazilian statesand municipalities from 2015 to 2020; it is suggested that surveys of this vectorbe conducted periodically in all Brazilian municipalities and authorities should developing control strategies for this species together with Ae. aegypti.

AB  - Zebrafish are increasingly being utilized as a model to investigate infectiousdiseases and to advance the understanding of pathogen-host interactions. Here, wetake advantage of the zebrafish to recapitulate congenital ZIKV infection and,for the first time, demonstrate that it can be used to model infection andreinfection and monitor anti-viral and inflammatory immune responses, as well as brain growth and eye abnormalities during embryonic development. By injecting aBrazilian strain of ZIKV into the yolk sac of one-cell stage embryos, weconfirmed that, after 72 h, ZIKV successfully infected larvae, and the physicalcondition of the virus-infected hosts included gross morphological changes insurviving embryos (84%), with a reduction in larval head size and retinal damage characterized by increased thickness of the lens and inner nuclear layer. Changesin locomotor activity and the inability to perceive visual stimuli are a resultof changes in retinal morphology caused by ZIKV. Furthermore, we demonstrated theability of ZIKV to replicate in zebrafish larvae and infect new healthy larvae,impairing their visual and neurological functions. These data reinforce thedeleterious activity of ZIKV in the brain and visual structures and establish thezebrafish as a model to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathology of the virus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the presented rheotaxis-based microfluidicdevice could be used to separate spermatozoa from viruses (i.e., Zika) in theinfected semen sample during the selection and washing process. DESIGN:Quantitative and experimental study of the sperm washing/selection processthrough the microfluidic platform exploiting the positive rheotaxis of sperm.SETTING: None. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Human sperm were purchased from a sperm bank. The raw semen sample was mixed withviruses and loaded into a microfluidic device. Experiments were performed with 2 different flow rates (0 and 25 muL/minute) to investigate the washing efficiency of the device in the sperm selection process. The sperm sample was collectedafter 45 minutes and analyzed to check whether the collected sample is free ofany infections (viruses) after isolation. RESULT(S): Fluorescent microscopy andquantitative polymerase chain reaction-based analysis showed that the spermselected with the presented rheotaxis-based microfluidic device at the optimalflow rate (25 muL/minute) was free of any viruses. CONCLUSION(S): We havedeveloped a simple, cost-effective microfluidic device that mimics the conditionsof the female genital tract while washing out the raw semen efficiently duringthe selection process for assisted reproductive technology.

AB  - Zika fever is an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). The disease is claiming millions of lives worldwide, primarily in developing countries. Inaddition to vector control strategies, the most effective way to prevent thespread of ZIKV infection is vaccination. There is no clinically approved vaccine to combat ZIKV infection and curb its pandemic. An epitope-based peptide vaccine (EBPV) is seen as a powerful alternative to conventional vaccinations because of its low production cost and short production time. Nonetheless, EBPVs have gottenless attention, despite the fact that they have a significant untapped potential for enhancing vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and cross-reactivity. Such avaccine technology is based on target pathogen's selected antigenic peptidescalled T-cell epitopes (TCE), which are synthesized chemically based on theiramino acid sequences. The identification of TCEs using wet-lab experimentalapproach is challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. Therefore in this study, we present computational model for the prediction of ZIKV TCEs. The modelproposed is an ensemble of decision trees that utilizes the physicochemicalproperties of amino acids. In this way a large amount of time and efforts wouldbe saved for quick vaccine development. The peptide sequences dataset for modeltraining was retrieved from Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. The sequences dataset consist of experimentally verified T-cellepitopes (TCEs) and non-TCEs. The model demonstrated promising results whenevaluated on test dataset. The evaluation metrics namely, accuracy, AUC,sensitivity, specificity, Gini and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC)recorded values of 0.9789, 0.984, 0.981, 0.987, 0.974 and 0.948 respectively. Theconsistency and reliability of the model was assessed by carrying out the five(05)-fold cross-validation technique, and the mean accuracy of 0.97864 wasreported. Finally, model was compared with standard machine learning (ML)algorithms and the proposed model outperformed all of them. The proposed modelwill aid in predicting novel and immunodominant TCEs of ZIKV. The predicted TCEs may have a high possibility of acting as prospective vaccine targets subjected toin-vivo and in-vitro scientific assessments, thereby saving lives worldwide,preventing future epidemic-scale outbreaks, and lowering the possibility ofmutation escape.

TI  - Evaluation of a multi-species Protein A-ELISA assay for plague serologicdiagnosis in humans and other mammal hosts.
PG  - e0009805
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009805 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hemagglutination assay (HA) is widely used in plague diagnosis,however, it has a subjective interpretation and demands high amounts of antigenand other immunobiological supplies. On the other hand, the conventional Anti-IgGELISA is limited by the need of specific conjugates for multiple plague hosts,which leaves a gap for new diagnostic methods able to cover both the diagnosis ofhuman cases and the epidemiological surveillance of multiple sentinel species.METHODS: We developed an ELISA Protein A-peroxidase method to detect anti-F1antibodies across several species, including humans. To determine the cut-off andperformance rates, HA results from 288 samples (81 rabbits, 64 humans, 66 rodentsand 77 dogs) were used as reference. Next, we evaluated the agreement betweenProtein A-ELISA and Anti-IgG ELISA in an expanded sample set (n = 487). RESULTS: Optimal conditions were found with 250ng/well of F1 and 1:500 serum dilution.Protein A-ELISA showed high repeatability and reproducibility. We observed goodcorrelation rates between the Protein A and IgG ELISAs optical densities and ahigher positive/negative OD ratio for the Protein A-ELISA method. The overallsensitivity, specificity and area under the curve for Protein A-ELISA were 94%,99% and 0.99, respectively. Similar results were observed for each speciesseparately. In the analysis of the expanded sample set, there was a strongagreement between Protein A and IgG assays (kappa = 0.97). Furthermore, there wasno cross-reaction with other common infectious diseases, such as dengue, Zika,Chagas disease, tuberculosis (humans) and ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis andleishmaniasis (dogs). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the Protein A-ELISA showed highperformance when compared both to HA and Anti-IgG ELISA, with a polyvalent singleprotocol that requires reduced amounts of antigen and can be employed to anyplague hosts.

AB  - The enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) need hostlipids to successfully replicate. The nature of the lipids and the replicationstep(s) where lipids are utilized often vary amongst viruses. In this study, wedemonstrate that ZIKV particle envelope is significantly enriched in distinctsphingolipid species. To determine the role of sphingolipids in ZIKV replication,we leveraged a panel of sphingolipid-deficient cell lines. Notably, knockout ofglucosylceramide and lactosylceramide synthase encoding genes (GCS(KO); B4G5(KO))resulted in a marked decrease in ZIKV titers. GCS(KO) or pharmacologicalinhibition of GCS also led to a significant decrease in ZIKV genome replication. Further analysis indicated that GCS(KO) reduced intracellular virus titers buthad minimal impact on ZIKV binding. Restoration of B4G5 expression in B4G5(KO)cells or supplementing PDMP-treated cells with glucosylceramide led to asignificant rescue of ZIKV replication. Altogether, our findings suggest thatZIKV needs glycosphingolipids to facilitate virus replication.

TI  - A bacterium-like particle vaccine displaying Zika virus prM-E induces systemicimmune responses in mice.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14594 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which is unexpectedly associatedwith congenital defects, has prompted the development of safe and effectivevaccines. The Gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) displaysystem has emerged as a versatile and highly effective platform for deliveringtarget proteins in vaccines. In this study, we developed a bacterium-likeparticle vaccine, ZI- big up tri, open-PA-GEM, based on the GEM-PA system. Thefusion protein ZI- big up tri, open-PA, which contains the prM-E- big up tri,openTM protein of ZIKV (with a stem-transmembrane region deletion) and theprotein anchor PA3, was expressed. The fusion protein was successfully displayed on the GEM surface to form ZI- big up tri, open-PA-GEM. Moreover, theintramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with ZI- big up tri, open-PA-GEMcombined with ISA 201 VG and poly(I:C) adjuvants induced durable ZIKV-specificIgG and protective neutralizing antibody responses. Potent B-cell/DC activationwas also stimulated early after immunization. Notable, splenocyte proliferation, the secretion of multiple cytokines, T/B-cell activation and central memoryT-cell responses were elicited. These data indicate that ZI- big up tri,open-PA-GEM is a promising bacterium-like particle vaccine candidate for ZIKV.

AB  - One of the main categories of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are arboviruses,of which Dengue and Chikungunya are the most common. Arboviruses mainly affecttropical countries. Brazil has the largest absolute number of cases in LatinAmerica. This work presents a unified data set with clinical, sociodemographic,and laboratorial data on confirmed patients of Dengue and Chikungunya, as well aspatients ruled out of infection from these diseases. The data is based on casenotification data submitted to the Brazilian Information System for NotifiableDiseases, from Portuguese Sistema de Informacao de Agravo de Notificacao (SINAN),from 2013 to 2020. The original data set comprised 13,421,230 records and 118attributes. Following a pre-processing process, a final data set of 7,632,542records and 56 attributes was generated. The data presented in this work willassist researchers in investigating antecedents of arbovirus emergence andtransmission more generally, and Dengue and Chikungunya in particular.Furthermore, it can be used to train and test machine learning models fordifferential diagnosis and multi-class classification.

TI  - The distinguishing NS5-M114V mutation in American Zika virus isolates hasnegligible impacts on virus replication and transmission potential.
PG  - e0010426
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010426 [doi]
AB  - During 2015-2016, outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) occurred in Southeast Asia andthe Americas. Most ZIKV infections in humans are asymptomatic, while clinicalmanifestation is usually a self-limiting febrile disease with maculopapular rash.However, ZIKV is capable of inducing a range of severe neurological complicationscollectively described as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Notably, the scale and magnitude of outbreaks in Southeast Asia were significantly smaller compared tothose in the Americas. Sequence comparison between epidemic-associated ZIKVstrains from Southeast Asia with those from the Americas revealed a methionine tovaline substitution at residue position 114 of the NS5 protein (NS5-M114V) in allthe American isolates. Using an American isolate of ZIKV (Natal), we investigatedthe impact of NS5-M114V mutation on virus replication in cells, virulence ininterferon (IFN) alpha/beta receptor knockout (Ifnar-/-) mice, as well asreplication and transmission potential in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wedemonstrated that NS5-M114V mutation had insignificant effect on ZIKV replicationefficiency in cells, its ability to degrade STAT2, and virulence in vivo, albeit viremia was slightly prolonged in mice. Furthermore, NS5-M114V mutation decreasedmosquito infection and dissemination rates but had no effect on virus secretioninto the saliva. Taken together, our findings support the notion that NS5-M114Vmutation is unlikely to be a major determinant for virus replication andtransmission potential.

TI  - Effective interventions to ensure MCH (Maternal and Child Health) services duringpandemic related health emergencies (Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19): A systematicreview.
PG  - e0268106
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268106 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ensuring accessible and quality health care for women and children is an existing challenge, which is further exacerbated during pandemics. There isa knowledge gap about the effect of pandemics on maternal, newborn, and childwell-being. This systematic review was conducted to study maternal and childhealth (MCH) services utilization during pandemics (Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19)and the effectiveness of various interventions undertaken for ensuringutilization of MCH services. METHODOLOGY: A systematic and comprehensive searchwas conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Epistemonikos,ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Of 5643 citations, 60 potential studies werefinally included for analysis. The included studies were appraised using JBICritical appraisal tools. Study selection and data extraction were doneindependently and in duplicate. Findings are presented narratively based on theRMNCHA framework by World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: Maternal and child health services such as antenatal care (ANC) visits, institutional deliveries,immunization uptake, were greatly affected during a pandemic situation.Innovative approaches in form of health care services through virtualconsultation, patient triaging, developing dedicated COVID maternity centers and maternity schools were implemented in different places for ensuring continuity ofMCH care during pandemics. None of the studies reported the effectiveness ofthese interventions during pandemic-related health emergencies. CONCLUSION: Thefindings suggest that during pandemics, MCH care utilization often gets affected.Many innovative interventions were adopted to ensure MCH services. However, they lack evidence about their effectiveness. It is critically important to implement evidence-based appropriate interventions for better MCH care utilization.

AB  - Dengue is a rapidly spreading arboviral disease that can be transmitted throughany of the four types of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. Previous studies haveobserved that individuals who have a pre-existing secondary infection due to adifferent dengue serotype, experience severe forms of this disease. During a DENVoutbreak, a time-sensitive preliminary diagnosis of the origin of DENV might beuseful in controlling the epidemic. Here, we developed a rapid and accurateone-step TB Green RT-PCR-based high-resolution melting (HRM) assay to identifyand serotype DENV using serotyping primers based on the alignment with the Egene. This assay had a detection limit of 7.7 x 10(2) (DENV 1), 3.8 x 10(2) (DENV2), 6.2 x 10(2) (DENV 3), and 1.2 x 10(3) (DENV 4) RNA copies/mL. Nocross-reactivity with the Chikungunya, Zika, and Japanese encephalitis viruseswas observed. The feasibility of using this assay for clinical diagnosis wasevaluated in DENV-positive patient sera. The HRM assay and the RT-qPCR hadcomplete matched results derived from DENV detection, including 51 serum positiveand 20 serum negative. Additionally, eight DENV 2 strains in the same serotypewere successfully differentiated by an HRM assay. Thus, this assay facilitatedaccurate detection and serotyping of DENV, along with the time-sensitiveidentification of the infectious focus of different DENVs.

AB  - Aedes-borne viruses (ABVs) such as dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika(ZIKV) contribute significantly to the global burden of infectious diseases,disproportionately affecting disadvantaged populations from tropical andsubtropical urban areas. ABVs can be transmitted from female mosquitoes to their progeny by vertical transmission via transovarial and/or trans-egg verticaltransmission and contribute to the maintenance of infected-mosquito populationsyear-round in endemic regions. This study describes the natural infection rate ofDENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in field-caught male Aedes (Sergentomyia) aegypti(Linnaeus) mosquitoes from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, as a proxy for the occurrenceof vertical virus transmission. We used indoor sequential sampling with Prokopackaspirators to collect all mosquitoes inside houses from ABV hotspots areas.Collections were performed in a DENV and CHIKV post-epidemic phase and during aperiod of active ZIKV transmission. We individually RT-qPCR tested all indoorcollected Ae. aegypti males (1,278) followed by Sanger sequencing analysis forfinal confirmation. A total of 6.7% male mosquitoes were positive for ABV (CHIKV = 5.7%; DENV = 0.9%; ZIKV = 0.1%) and came from 21.0% (30/143) houses infestedwith males. Most ABV-positive male mosquitoes were positive for CHIKV (84.8%).The distribution of ABV-positive Ae. aegypti males was aggregated in a fewhouseholds, with two houses having 11 ABV-positive males each. We found apositive association between ABV-positive males and females per house. Thesefindings suggested the occurrence of vertical arbovirus transmission within themosquito populations in an ABV-endemic area and, a mechanism contributing toviral maintenance and virus re-emergence among humans in post-epidemic periods.

AB  - Despite substantial morbidity and mortality, no therapeutic agents exist fortreatment of dengue or Zika, and the currently available dengue vaccine is onlyrecommended for dengue virus (DENV)-immune individuals. Thus, development oftherapeutic and/or preventive drugs is urgently needed. DENV and Zika virus(ZIKV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can directly trigger endothelial barrierdysfunction and induce inflammatory responses, contributing to vascular leak invivo. Here we evaluated the efficacy of the (1-6,1-3)-beta-D-glucan isolated fromAgaricus subrufescens fruiting bodies (FR) and its sulfated derivative (FR-S)against DENV-2 and ZIKV infection and NS1-mediated pathogenesis. FR-S, but notFR, significantly inhibited DENV-2 and ZIKV replication in human monocytic cells (EC50 = 36.5 and 188.7 mug/mL, respectively) when added simultaneously with viralinfection. No inhibitory effect was observed when FR or FR-S were addedpost-infection, suggesting inhibition of viral entry as a mechanism of action. Inan in vitro model of endothelial permeability using human pulmonary microvascularendothelial cells (HPMECs), FR and FR-S (0.12 mug/mL) inhibited DENV-2 NS1- andZIKV NS1-induced hyperpermeability by 50% and 100%, respectively, as measured by Trans-Endothelial Electrical Resistance. Treatment with 0.25 mug/mL of FR andFR-S inhibited DENV-2 NS1 binding to HPMECs. Further, FR-S significantly reduced intradermal hyperpermeability induced by DENV-2 NS1 in C57BL/6 mice and protectedagainst DENV-induced morbidity and mortality in a murine model of dengue vascularleak syndrome. Thus, we demonstrate efficacy of FR-S against DENV and ZIKVinfection and NS1-induced endothelial permeability in vitro and in vivo. Thesefindings encourage further exploration of FR-S and other glycan candidates forflavivirus treatment alone or in combination with compounds with differentmechanisms of action.

LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00592-22 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses are important human pathogens worldwide. Diagnostic testing forthese viruses is difficult because many of the pathogens require specializedbiocontainment. To address this issue, we generated 39 virus-like particle (VLP)-and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-secreting stable cell lines in HEK-293 cells of13 different flaviviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis,West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, Zika, Rocio, Ilheus, Usutu, and Powassanviruses. Antigen secretion was stable for at least 10 cell passages, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence assays. Thirty-five cell lines (90%) had stable antigen expression over 10 passages, with three ofthese cell lines (7%) increasing in antigen expression and one cell line (3%)decreasing in antigen expression. Antigen secretion in the HEK-293 cell lines washigher than in previously developed COS-1 cell line counterparts. These antigens can replace current antigens derived from live or inactivated virus for safer usein diagnostic testing. IMPORTANCE Serological diagnostic testing for flaviviralinfections is hindered by the need for specialized biocontainment for preparationof reagents and assay implementation. The use of previously developed COS-1 cell lines secreting noninfectious recombinant viral antigen is limited due todiminished antigen secretion over time. Here, we describe the generation of 39flaviviral virus-like particle (VLP)- and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-secretingstable cell lines in HEK-293 cells representing 13 medically importantflaviviruses. Antigen production was more stable and statistically higher inthese newly developed cell lines than in their COS-1 cell line counterparts. The use of these cell lines for production of flaviviral antigens will expandserological diagnostic testing of flaviviruses worldwide.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 mediated sex-ratio distortion by sex specific gene editing in Aedesaegypti.
PG  - 3015-3022
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2022.01.034 [doi]
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a principal vector for several viruses including dengue virus,chikungunya virus and zika virus. Economic burden of mosquito-borne diseases,relative failure of traditional control strategies and the resistance developmentagainst insecticides enforces towards genetic manipulation of Ae. aegypti. Hence,a key gene doublesex (Aedsx) which regulate sex differentiation and alternativelysplices to form male and female specific transcripts (Aedsx(M) and Aedsx(F) ).CRISPR/Cas9 technique was employed to sex specifically disrupt thefemale-specific isoforms, Aedsx(F1) and Aedsx(F2) , both of which were shown tobe expressed only in female mosquitoes. Targeting of dsx(F) at the developmental stage has resulted in various phenotypic anomalies of adult females. The rate of adult mutation phenotype was recorded between 29 and 37% along with anomalies of wing size, proboscis length and reduction in the sizes of pre-blood-meal andafter blood-meal ovaries in dsx(F1) and dsx(F2) microinjected groups,respectively. These findings can be correlated with reduced fecundity rate of Go female, where Aedsx(F1) and Aedsx(F2) groups showed reduction rate in range of23-31%. Furthermore, hatching inhibition rate of 28 to 36% was also observed inG1 generation when compared to the wildtype. Overall, these results demonstrated that Aedsx(F) disruption has resulted in multiple female traits disruptionincluding decreased fertility of the female that could directly or indirectlyassociated with reproduction and its disease transmitting abilities. All thesefindings suggesting that CRISPR works to alter the developmental pathways aspredicted, and therefore this method potentially gives us the basis for thesex-ratio distortion system as genetic control approach for the management ofthis vector.

AB  - Trophoblast organoids derived from placental villi provide a 3D model system ofhuman placental development, but access to first-trimester tissues is limited.Here, we report that trophoblast stem cells isolated from naive human pluripotentstem cells (hPSCs) can efficiently self-organize into 3D stem-cell-derivedtrophoblast organoids (SC-TOs) with a villous architecture similar to primarytrophoblast organoids. Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals the presence ofdistinct cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast clusters and a small cluster of extravillous trophoblasts, which closely correspond to trophoblast identities in the post-implantation embryo. These organoid cultures display clonal X chromosomeinactivation patterns previously described in the human placenta. We furtherdemonstrate that SC-TOs exhibit selective vulnerability to emerging pathogens(SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus), which correlates with expression levels of theirrespective entry factors. The generation of trophoblast organoids from naivehPSCs provides an accessible 3D model system of the developing placenta and itssusceptibility to emerging pathogens.

TI  - Intrinsic features of Zika Virus non-structural proteins NS2A and NS4A in theregulation of viral replication.
PG  - e0010366
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010366 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and can cause neurodevelopmentaldisorders in fetus. As a neurotropic virus, ZIKV persistently infects neuraltissues during pregnancy but the viral pathogenesis remains largely unknown. ZIKVhas a positive-sense and single-stranded RNA genome, which encodes 7non-structural (NS) proteins, participating in viral replication anddysregulation of host immunity. Like those in many other viruses, NS proteins areconsidered to be products evolutionarily beneficiary to viruses and some arevirulence factors. However, we found that some NS proteins encoded by ZIKV genomeappeared to function against the viral replication. In this report we showed thatexogenously expressed ZIKV NS2A and NS4A inhibited ZIKV infection by inhibitingviral RNA replication in microglial cells and astrocytes. To understand how viralNS proteins suppressed viral replication, we analyzed the transcriptome of themicroglial cells and astrocytes and found that expression of NS4A induced theupregulation of ISGs, including MX1/2, OAS1/2/3, IFITM1, IFIT1, IFI6, IFI27,ISG15 or BST2 through activating the ISGF3 signaling pathway. Upregulation ofthese ISGs seemed to be related to the inhibition of ZIKV replication, since the anti-ZIKV function of NS4A was partially attenuated when the cells were treatedwith Abrocitinib, an inhibitor of the ISGF3 signaling pathway, or were knockeddown with STAT2. Aborting the protein expression of NS4A, but not its nucleicacid, eliminated the antiviral activity of NS4A effectively. Dynamic expressionof viral NS proteins was examined in ZIKV-infected microglial cells andastrocytes, which showed comparatively NS4A occurred later than other NS proteinsduring the infection. We hypothesize that NS4A may possess intrinsic features to serve as a unique type of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP),detectable by the cells to induce an innate immune response, or function withother mechanisms, to restrict the viral replication to a certain level as anegative feedback, which may help ZIKV maintain its persistent infection in fetalneural tissues.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection at the maternal-placental interface is associatedwith adverse pregnancy outcomes including fetal demise and pregnancy loss. Todetermine how infection impacts placental trophoblasts, we utilized rhesusmacaque trophoblast stem cells (TSC) that can be differentiated into earlygestation syncytiotrophoblasts (ST) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT). TSCs andSTs, but not EVTs, were highly permissive to productive infection with ZIKVstrain DAK AR 41524. The impact of ZIKV on the cellular transcriptome showed thatinfection of TSCs and STs increased expression of immune related genes, includingthose involved in type I and type III interferon responses. ZIKV exposure alteredextracellular vesicle (EV) mRNA, miRNA and protein cargo, including ZIKVproteins, regardless of productive infection. These findings suggest that earlygestation macaque TSCs and STs are permissive to ZIKV infection, and that EVanalysis may provide a foundation for identifying non-invasive biomarkers ofplacental infection in a highly translational model.

AB  - Hypsarrhythmia is a specific chaotic morphology, present in the interictal periodof the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in patients with West Syndrome (WS), asevere form of childhood epilepsy and that, recently, was also identified in the examinations of patients with Zika Virus Congenital Syndrome (ZVCS). Thisinnovative work proposes the development of a computational methodology foranalysis and differentiation, based on the time-frequency domain, between thechaotic pattern of WS and ZVCS hypsarrhythmia. The EEG signal time-frequencyanalysis is carried out from the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Four jointmoments-joint mean-[Formula: see text], joint variance-[Formula: see text], jointskewness-[Formula: see text], and joint kurtosis-[Formula: see text]-and fourentropy measurements-Shannon, Log Energy, Norm, and Sure-are obtained from theCWT to compose the representative feature vector of the EEG hypsarrhythmicsignals under analysis. The performance of eight classical types of machinelearning algorithms are verified in classification using the k-fold crossvalidation and leave-one-patient-out cross validation methods. Discriminationresults provided 78.08% accuracy, 85.55% sensitivity, 73.21% specificity, and AUC= 0.89 for the ANN classifier.

AB  - This article uses a socio-anthropological framework to explore the stigmas aroundinteractions with children born with congenital Zika syndrome caused by the Zika virus epidemic in two Brazilian municipalities. Semi-structured interviews wereconducted with parents and other relatives. We reflected on the search formeaning when having a baby with unexpected body marks, the moral suffering, thesocietal ableism, the burden of care, and the need for support networks. Weconcluded that public policies, especially social policies (health, education,and social assistance), are essential for compensatory mechanisms, recognition,and social inclusion of these children and their families.

AB  - This study aims to estimate fertility trends in Brazil in the 2010s and early2020s during a period of back-to-back novel infectious disease outbreaks - Zikavirus and COVID-19. We use Brazilian Ministry of Health and Association of Civil Registrar data from 2011-2021 to measure general fertility rates at the national and state levels. We also used seasonal ARIMA model to forecast fertility ratesby month and state in 2021 and compared these forecasts with observed fertilityrates. We find that fertility rates were steady over 2011-2015 with nostatistically significant variation, followed by a sharp decline during the Zika outbreak in 2016 followed by a return to pre-Zika levels after the end of theepidemic. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, we makecomparisons with observed and forecast rates from 2020-2021, showing thatdeclines were generally larger for observed than for forecast rates, yetstatistically insignificant. We argue that the resurgence of the COVID-19pandemic in 2021 might lead to further declines, as women might have not hadenough time to adjust rebound from either the effects of the Zika epidemic. Wealso discuss the importance of timely availability of live births data during apublic health crisis with immediate consequences for fertility rates.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: SARS-CoV-2 infection typically presents with fever and respiratorysymptoms. Besides this, COVID-19 related central and peripheral nervous systemmanifestations are emerging. OBJECTIVES: This study summarises the demographics, clinical profile, laboratory findings, management strategies, and outcomes in alarge number of patients with COVID-19 related GBS and its variants. We alsocompared its clinical profile with Zika and dengue virus-related GBS. METHODS:Authors carried out a literature search up to Dec 31, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed,SCOPUS, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar for all published articles.RESULTS: The study identified 54 different types of articles consisting of 70cases from 17 countries worldwide. Maximum cases 15 (21.4%) were identified from Italy, followed by USA 12 (17.1%), Spain 11 (15.7%), and Iran 10 (14.3%). The agegroup more than 60 years had most cases with 32 (45.7%) cases followed by agegroup 40-60 with cases 25 (35.7%) with male and female ratio 2. Maximum caseswere treated with IVIG infusion 58 (82.9%), followed by Plasma exchange 13(18.6%) cases. Out of 70 cases, 7 (10%) cases were manifested as Miller-Fishersyndrome. The most predominant electrodiagnostic variant was demyelinatingneuropathy in 41 (73.21%) cases. The outcome reported in 67 cases was survival in63 (90%) cases and the death of 4 (5.7%) cases. CONCLUSION: Covid 19 related GBS were reported worldwide with a better outcome. Both postinfectious orparainfectious patterns were reported. Early recognition with prompt managementof GBS can prevent further severe morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Possible Routes for Zika Virus Vertical Transmission in Human Placenta: AComprehensive Review.
PG  - 392-403
LID - 10.1089/vim.2021.0199 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have gained notoriety due to congenitalabnormalities. Pregnant women have a greater risk of ZIKV infection andconsequent transmission to their progeny due to the immunological changesassociated with pregnancy. ZIKV has been detected in amniotic fluid, as well asin fetal and neonatal tissues of infected pregnant women. However, the mechanism by which ZIKV reaches the fetus is not well understood. The four dengue virusserotypes have been the most widely used flaviviruses to elucidate the host-cell entry pathways. Nevertheless, it is of increasing interest to understand thespecific interaction between ZIKV and the host cell, especially in the gestation period. Herein, the authors describe the mechanisms of prenatal verticalinfection of ZIKV based on results from in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies,including murine models and nonhuman primates. It also includes up-to-dateknowledge from ex vivo and natural infections in pregnant women explaining thevertical transmission along four tracks: transplacental, paracellular,transcytosis mediated by extracellular vesicles, and paraplacental route and the antibody-dependent enhancement process. A global understanding of the diversepathways used by ZIKV to cross the placental barrier and access the fetus, along with a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of ZIKV in pregnant females, may constitute a fundamental role in the design of antiviral drugs to reducecongenital disabilities associated with ZIKV.

AB  - Nonhuman primates (NHP) are particularly important for modeling infections withviruses that do not naturally replicate in rodent cells. Zika virus (ZIKV) hasbeen responsible for sporadic epidemics, but in 2015 a disseminated outbreak ofZIKV resulted in the World Health Organization declaring it a global healthemergency. Since the advent of this last epidemic, several NHP species, includingthe baboon, have been utilized for modeling and understanding the complicationsof ZIKV infection in humans; several health issues related to the outcome ofinfection have not been resolved yet and require further investigation. Thisstudy was designed to validate, in baboons, the molecular signatures that havepreviously been identified in ZIKV-infected humans and macaque models. Weperformed a comprehensive molecular analysis of baboons during acute ZIKVinfection, including flow cytometry, cytokine, immunological, and transcriptomic analyses. We show here that, similar to most human cases, ZIKV infection of male baboons tends to be subclinical, but is associated with a rapid and transientantiviral interferon-based response signature that induces a detectable humoraland cell-mediated immune response. This immunity against the virus protectsanimals from challenge with a divergent ZIKV strain, as evidenced by undetectableviremia but clear anamnestic responses. These results provide additional support for the use of baboons as an alternative animal model to macaques and validateomic techniques that could help identify the molecular basis of complicationsassociated with ZIKV infections in humans.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic flavivirus recently linked to congenital ZIKV syndrome in children and encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults.Neurotropic viruses often use axons to traffic to neuronal or glial cell somaswhere they either remain latent or replicate and proceed to infect new cells.Consequently, it has been suggested that axon degeneration could represent anevolutionarily conserved mechanism to limit viral spread. Whilst it is not known if ZIKV transits in axons, we previously reported that ZIKV infection of glialcells in a murine spinal cord-derived cell culture model of the CNS is associatedwith a profound loss of neuronal cell processes. This, despite that postmitoticneurons are relatively refractory to infection and death. Here, we tested thehypothesis that ZIKV-associated degeneration of neuronal processes is dependenton activation of Sterile alpha and armadillo motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1), an NADase that acts as a central executioner in a conserved axon degenerationpathway. To test this, we infected wild type and Sarm1 homozygous or heterozygousnull cell cultures with ZIKV and examined NAD(+) levels as well as the survivalof neurons and their processes. Unexpectedly, ZIKV infection led to a rapidSARM1-independent reduction in NAD(+). Nonetheless, the subsequent profound loss of neuronal cell processes was SARM1-dependent and was preceded by early changes in the appearance of beta-tubulin III staining. Together, these data identify arole for SARM1 in the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, which may reflect SARM1'sconserved prodegenerative function, independent of its NADase activity.

AB  - Over the last decade, the release of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti into thenatural habitat of this mosquito species has become the most sustainable andlong-lasting technique to prevent and control vector-borne diseases, such asdengue, zika, or chikungunya. However, the limited resources to generate suchmosquitoes and their effective distribution in large areas dominated by the Aedesaegypti vector represent a challenge for policymakers. Here, we introduce amathematical framework for the spread of dengue in which competition between wildand Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, the cross-contagion patterns between humansand vectors, the heterogeneous distribution of the human population in different areas, and the mobility flows between them are combined. Our framework allows us to identify the most effective areas for the release of Wolbachia-infectedmosquitoes to achieve a large decrease in the global dengue prevalence.

AB  - In this study Pergularia daemia unripe fruits were used to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles (Pd-ZnONPs). UV-vis Spectroscopy detected the production of ZnONPs.XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM studies were used to characterize the synthesizedPd-ZnONPs. Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) third instar larvae were analyzed todiverse concentrations of Pd-unripe fruit extract and Pd-ZnONPs for 24 hours toassess the larvicidal effect. Mortality was also detected in Ae. aegypti larvaeunder laboratory conditions, with corresponding LC50 and LC90 values of 11.11 and21.20 microg/ml respectively. As a result of this study, the levels of totalproteins, esterases, acetylcholine esterase, and phosphatase enzymes in the thirdinstar larvae of Ae. aegypti were significantly lower than the control. Thesefindings suggest that Pd-ZnONPs could be used to suppress mosquito larvalpopulations.

AB  - The recent worldwide spread of viral infections has highlighted the need foraccurate, fast, and inexpensive disease diagnosis and monitorization methods.Current diagnostics tend to focus either on molecular or serological testing. In this work we propose a dual detection assay approach for viral diseases, whereboth serological and molecular assays are combined in a single analysis performedon a magnetoresistive system. This type of assay guarantees an accurateassessment of the infection phase, saving time and costs associated with multipleindependent tests. Zika and dengue viruses were used as model diseases for thevalidation of the system. Human IgG anti-zika and anti-dengue antibodies weresuccessfully detected in infected patients' serum, using a novel approachcombining competitive and sandwich strategies in a magnetoresistive portableplatform. Specificity and sensitivity values of 100% were obtained. Calibrationcurves with dynamic ranges between 10 ng/mL and 1 mug/mL were establishedachieving LODs of 1.26 and 1.38 nM for IgG anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV antibodies,respectively. Viral RNA detection down to a few hundreds of pM was alsosuccessfully carried out after the design of specific oligo probes and primersfor RT-PCR amplification. Dual assays were performed for both viruses, whereviral RNA and anti-virus antibodies in serum samples were simultaneouslydetected. The results obtained for the detection of the molecular and serologicaltargets in the dual assay format show no significant difference between the ones obtained individually, proving the feasibility and accuracy of the dual detectionassay. This assay format represents a new paradigm in viral infectionsdiagnostics.

LID - 10.1111/odi.14227 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to investigate the impact of the severity of microcephaly caused bythe Zika virus (MCZ) on tooth eruption and orofacial structures of children.DESIGN: This case series study developed the research at the Mens SanaRehabilitation Center, Arcoverde, Brazil. The study included 27 childrendiagnosed with MCZ. We performed the data collection in June 2018 through aquestionnaire answered by the legal guardians, followed by a clinical examinationof the children. The data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exacttests (p = 0.05). RESULTS: The final sample was composed of 20 children. Ofthese, 13 (35.0%) had severe microcephaly, 5 (30.0%) had altered sequence oftooth eruption, 10 (50.0%) had delayed eruption, and the mean number of decayedteeth was 2.3. The most identified orofacial changes were teeth grinding habit(65.0%), difficult chewing (50.0%), and non-nutritive sucking (50.0%). TheMann-Whitney test showed that the severity of microcephaly did not affect tootheruption (p = 0.581). The Fisher's exact test showed that the severity ofmicrocephaly was not associated with orofacial changes (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:The severity of MCZ does not seem to influence changes in deciduous tootheruption and the presence of orofacial anomalies.

AB  - Owing to the global spread of the Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, field-readydiagnostics are urgently warranted. In this study, we sought to detect ZIKV usingreverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Briefly, we performed and optimized ZIKV RT-LAMP for the analysis of biological samples(PBS, urine, and plasma). Based on our findings, this method could detect ZIKVRNA in 40 min at 63 degrees C without any off-target amplification. Afterperforming specificity tests using BtsI restriction enzyme digestion, thefeasibility of ZIKV RT-LAMP was determined via end-point detection with differentsample matrices. Thereafter, a lateral flow assay (LFA) was conducted to directlydetect the ZIKV RT-LAMP products. Based on the LFA reaction, hybridizationoccurred between the AuNPs:polyadenylated (polyA10)-ZIKV probe and the LAMPamplicons. Subsequently, we optimized the assay parameters, including theconcentration of AuNPs and migration matrices (glass fiber and nitrocellulosemembrane). By employing a specific AuNP:polyA10-ZIKV LAMP probe, we coulddemonstrate the purpose and utility of primary and secondary antibodies. Owing toLFA, the resultant ZIKV RT-LAMP products were rapidly and simply assayed in less than 5 min. Further, no preparation step was required to achieve LAMP-probehybridization, highlighting the utility of this method for field-ready ZIKVdiagnosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that ZIKV RT-LAMP combined with LFAcould serve as a rapid, accurate, and independent point-of-care detection method for preventing ZIKV outbreaks.

TI  - Regulatory Role of Host MicroRNAs in Flaviviruses Infection.
PG  - 869441
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.869441 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA that affect mRNA abundance ortranslation efficiency by binding to the 3'UTR of the mRNA of the target gene,thereby participating in multiple biological processes, including viralinfection. Flavivirus genus consists of small, positive-stranded, single-strandedRNA viruses transmitted by arthropods, especially mosquitoes and ticks. The genuscontains several globally significant human/animal pathogens, such as Denguevirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Yellow fevervirus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Tembusu virus. After flavivirusinvades, the expression of host miRNA changes, exerting the immune escapemechanism to create an environment conducive to its survival, and the alteredmiRNA in turn affects the life cycle of the virus. Accumulated evidence suggests that host miRNAs influence flavivirus replication and host-virus interactionsthrough direct binding of viral genomes or through virus-mediated hosttranscriptome changes. Furthermore, miRNA can also interweave with othernon-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding RNA and circular RNA, to form aninteraction network to regulate viral replication. A variety of non-coding RNAsproduced by the virus itself exert similar function by interacting with cellular RNA and viral RNA. Understanding the interaction sites between non-coding RNA,especially miRNA, and virus/host genes will help us to find targets for antiviraldrugs and viral therapy.

AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) disease caused a public health emergency of internationalconcern that started in February 2016. The overall number of ZIKV-related casesincreased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While theevaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remainschallenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKVwhole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns ofgenetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classificationsystem that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Ourobjective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamicclassification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length codingregion of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionarydynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses,within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection ofselective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombinationevents was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events arelikely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There wasevidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as alsodetected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positiveselection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA)differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined,ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized 'African' and 'Asian'genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent theAsiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is furthersubdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and arecent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, andMicronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak inSingapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and thesequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South Americaintroduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and NorthAmerica). This classification system does not use geographical references and is flexible to accommodate potential future lineages. It will be a helpful tool for studies that involve analyses of ZIKV genomic variation and its association with pathogenicity and serve as a starting point for the public health surveillanceand response to on-going and future epidemics and to outbreaks that lead to theemergence of new variants.

AB  - The deacetylase HDAC6 has tandem catalytic domains and a zinc finger domain (ZnF)binding ubiquitin (Ub). While the catalytic domain has an antiviral effect, theZnF facilitates influenza A virus (IAV) infection and cellular stress responses. By recruiting Ub via the ZnF, HDAC6 promotes the formation of aggresomes andstress granules (SGs), dynamic structures associated with pathologies such asneurodegeneration. IAV subverts the aggresome/HDAC6 pathway to facilitate capsid uncoating during early infection. To target this pathway, we generate designedankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) binding the ZnF; one of these preventsinteraction with Ub in vitro and in cells. Crystallographic analysis shows thatit blocks the ZnF pocket where Ub engages. Conditional expression of this DARPin reversibly impairs infection by IAV and Zika virus; moreover, SGs and aggresomes are downregulated. These results validate the HDAC6 ZnF as an attractive targetfor drug discovery.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a human pathogenic arbovirus. So far, neither a specifictreatment nor a vaccination against ZIKV infections has been approved. Startingfrom our previously described lead structure, a series of 29 new macrocyclicinhibitors of the Zika virus protease containing different linker motifs havebeen synthesized. By selecting hydrophobic d-amino acids as part of the linker,numerous inhibitors with Ki values < 5 nM were obtained. For 12 inhibitors,crystal structures in complex with the ZIKV protease up to 1.30 A resolution weredetermined, which contribute to the understanding of the observedstructure-activity relationship (SAR). In immunofluorescence assays, an antiviraleffect was observed for compound 26 containing a d-homocyclohexylalanine residue in its linker segment. Due to its excellent selectivity profile and lowcytotoxicity, this inhibitor scaffold could be a suitable starting point for the development of peptidic drugs against the Zika virus and related flaviviruses.

TI  - Interferon Lambda Signals in Maternal Tissues to Exert Protective and Pathogenic Effects in a Gestational Stage-Dependent Manner.
PG  - e0385721
LID - 10.1128/mbio.03857-21 [doi]
AB  - Interferon lambda (IFN-lambda) (type III IFN) is constitutively secreted fromhuman placental cells in culture and reduces Zika virus (ZIKV) transplacentaltransmission in mice. However, the roles of IFN-lambda during healthy pregnancyand in restricting congenital infection remain unclear. Here, we used micelacking the IFN-lambda receptor (Ifnlr1(-/-)) to generate pregnancies lackingeither maternal or fetal IFN-lambda responsiveness and found that the antiviraleffect of IFN-lambda resulted from signaling exclusively in maternal tissues.This protective effect depended on gestational stage, as infection earlier inpregnancy (E7 rather than E9) resulted in enhanced transplacental transmission ofZIKV. In Ifnar1(-/-) dams, which sustain robust ZIKV infection, maternalIFN-lambda signaling caused fetal resorption and intrauterine growth restriction.Pregnancy pathology elicited by poly(I.C) treatment also was mediated by maternalIFN-lambda signaling, specifically in maternal leukocytes, and also occurred in agestational stage-dependent manner. These findings identify an unexpected effect of IFN-lambda signaling, specifically in maternal (rather than placental orfetal) tissues, which is distinct from the pathogenic effects of IFN-alphabeta(type I IFN) during pregnancy. These results highlight the complexity of immunesignaling at the maternal-fetal interface, where disparate outcomes can resultfrom signaling at different gestational stages. IMPORTANCE Pregnancy is animmunologically complex situation, which must balance protecting the fetus frommaternal pathogens with preventing maternal immune rejection of non-self fetaland placental tissue. Cytokines, such as interferon lambda (IFN-lambda),contribute to antiviral immunity at the maternal-fetal interface. We found in amouse model of congenital Zika virus infection that IFN-lambda can have either a protective antiviral effect or cause immune-mediated pathology, depending on the stage of gestation when IFN-lambda signaling occurs. Remarkably, both theprotective and pathogenic effects of IFN-lambda occurred through signalingexclusively in maternal immune cells rather than in fetal or placental tissues orin other maternal cell types, identifying a new role for IFN-lambda at thematernal-fetal interface.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the differences in clinical presentation and relativedisease burden of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS)-associated microcephaly at 2large hospitals in Salvador, Brazil that serve patients of differentsocioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Clinical and serologic data were collectedprospectively from pregnant women and their infants, who delivered at 2 studycenters during the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Salvador, Brazil.RESULTS: Pregnant women from Salvador, Brazil delivering in a low SES hospitalhad 3 times higher ZIKV exposure rate than women at a high SES hospital. However,different SES hospitals had similar prevalence of infants with CZS-associatedmicrocephaly (10% vs 6%, p = 0.16) after controlling for ZIKV exposure in theirmothers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the positive association between lowSES, high maternal ZIKV exposure, and high rates of CZS-associated microcephaly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is predicted that approximately two billion tourist trips toforeign countries will be taken worldwide each year by 2030. Germany has longbeen among the most active countries in tourism. The frequency of illness amongpersons returning from developing and newly industrialized countries is 43-79%.The appropriate diagnosis of fever in returning travelers is a clinicallyimportant matter, as it can be a sign of a life-threatening illness. METHODS:This review is based on publications (2001-2022) retrieved by a selective search in PubMed for studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of febrileillnesses in returning travelers, or on specific tropical diseases. RESULTS:Diarrhea, fever, and skin changes are the most common manifestations of diseaseafter travel to tropical and subtropical areas. The diagnostic evaluation should be performed in a series of steps, beginning with a precise travel history andthe identification of specific risk factors. Among travelers returning fromsub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the most common cause offever on presentation to centers for infectious diseases and tropical medicine,affecting approximately 50 per 1000 travelers. Among persons returning fromtravel to Southeast Asia, dengue fever is the most common infectious disease,affecting 50-160 per 1000 travelers. Further potentially dangerous diseasesinclude chikungunya and zika fever, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, amoebic liver abscess, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), leptospirosis, and, very rarely,imported cases of viral hemorrhagic fever. COVID-19 and influenza are importantdifferential diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis can be narrowed bythorough history-taking with particular attention to the patient's travel route, combined with a good knowledge of the geographic spread and incubation times ofthe main tropical diseases. Algorithms help clinicians to focus the diagnosticwork-up and select the appropriate further laboratory tests and diagnosticprocedures.

TI  - Temperate Conditions Limit Zika Virus Genome Replication.
PG  - e0016522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00165-22 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus known to cause severe birth defects andneuroimmunological disorders. We have previously demonstrated that mosquitotransmission of Zika virus decreases with temperature. While transmission wasoptimized at 29 degrees C, it was limited at cool temperatures (<22 degrees C)due to poor virus establishment in the mosquitoes. Temperature is one of thestrongest drivers of vector-borne disease transmission due to its profound effecton ectothermic mosquito vectors, viruses, and their interaction. Although thereis substantial evidence of temperature effects on arbovirus replication anddissemination inside mosquitoes, little is known about whether temperatureaffects virus replication directly or indirectly through mosquito physiology. In order to determine the mechanisms behind temperature-induced changes in Zikavirus transmission potential, we investigated different steps of the virusreplication cycle in mosquito cells (C6/36) at optimal (28 degrees C) and cool(20 degrees C) temperatures. We found that the cool temperature did not alterZika virus entry or translation, but it affected genome replication and reducedthe amount of double-stranded RNA replication intermediates. If replicationcomplexes were first formed at 28 degrees C and the cells were subsequentlyshifted to 20 degrees C, the late steps in the virus replication cycle wereefficiently completed. These data suggest that cool temperature decreases theefficiency of Zika virus genome replication in mosquito cells. This phenotype wasobserved in the Asian lineage of Zika virus, while the African lineage Zika viruswas less restricted at 20 degrees C. IMPORTANCE With half of the human populationat risk, arboviral diseases represent a substantial global health burden. Zikavirus, previously known to cause sporadic infections in humans, emerged in theAmericas in 2015 and quickly spread worldwide. There was an urgent need to betterunderstand the disease pathogenesis and develop therapeutics and vaccines, aswell as to understand, predict, and control virus transmission. In order toefficiently predict the seasonality and geography for Zika virus transmission, weneed a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions and how they can bealtered by environmental factors such as temperature. Identifying the step in thevirus replication cycle that is inhibited under cool conditions can haveimplications in modeling the temperature suitability for arbovirus transmissionas global environmental patterns change. Understanding the link between pathogen replication and environmental conditions can potentially be exploited to develop new vector control strategies in the future.

TI  - Consequences of Viral Infection and Cytokine Production During Pregnancy on BrainDevelopment in Offspring.
PG  - 816619
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.816619 [doi]
AB  - Infections during pregnancy can seriously damage fetal neurodevelopment byaberrantly activating the maternal immune system, directly impacting fetal neuralcells. Increasing evidence suggests that these adverse impacts involvealterations in neural stem cell biology with long-term consequences foroffspring, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrumdisorder, schizophrenia, and cognitive impairment. Here we review how maternalinfection with viruses such as Influenza A, Cytomegalovirus, and Zika duringpregnancy can affect the brain development of offspring by promoting the release of maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines, triggering neuroinflammation of the fetalbrain, and/or directly infecting fetal neural cells. In addition, we reviewinsights into how these infections impact human brain development from studieswith animal models and brain organoids. Finally, we discuss how maternalinfection with SARS-CoV-2 may have consequences for neurodevelopment of theoffspring.

PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02460-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus of global concern. ZIKVinfection of the central nervous system has been linked to a variety of clinical syndromes, including microcephaly in fetuses and rare but serious neurologicdisease in adults. However, the potential for ZIKV to influence brain physiology and host behavior following apparently mild or subclinical infection is less wellunderstood. Furthermore, though deficits in cognitive function arewell-documented after recovery from neuroinvasive viral infection, the potential impact of ZIKV on other host behavioral domains has not been thoroughly explored.METHODS: We used transcriptomic profiling, including unbiased gene ontologyenrichment analysis, to assess the impact of ZIKV infection on gene expression inprimary cortical neuron cultures. These studies were extended with molecularbiological analysis of gene expression and inflammatory cytokine signaling. Invitro observations were further confirmed using established in vivo models ofZIKV infection in immunocompetent hosts. RESULTS: Transcriptomic profiling ofprimary neuron cultures following ZIKV infection revealed altered expression ofkey genes associated with major psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorderand schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also revealed significantchanges in gene expression associated with fundamental neurobiological processes,including neuronal development, neurotransmission, and others. These alterations to neurologic gene expression were also observed in the brain in vivo usingseveral immunocompetent mouse models of ZIKV infection. Mechanistic studiesidentified TNF-alpha signaling via TNFR1 as a major regulatory mechanismcontrolling ZIKV-induced changes to neurologic gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies reveal that cell-intrinsic innate immune responses to ZIKV infectionprofoundly shape neuronal transcriptional profiles, highlighting the need tofurther explore associations between ZIKV infection and disordered hostbehavioral states.

AB  - Epidemics caused by flaviviruses occur globally; however, no antiviral drugstreating flaviviruses infections have yet been developed. Nafamostat (NM) is aprotease inhibitor approved for pancreatitis and anti-coagulation. Theanti-flavivirus potential of NM has yet to be determined. Here, utilizing invitro and in vivo infection assays, we present that NM effectively inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) and other flaviviruses in vitro. NM inhibited the production of ZIKVviral RNA and proteins originating from Asia and African lineage in human-,mouse- and monkey-derived cell lines and the in vivo anti-ZIKV efficacy of NM wasverified. Mode-of-action analysis using time-of-drug-addition assay, infectivity inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance assay, and molecular docking revealedthat NM interacted with viral particles and blocked the early stage of infection by targeting the domain III of ZIKV envelope protein. Analysing theanti-flavivirus effects of NM-related compounds suggested that the antiviraleffect depended on the unique structure of NM. These findings suggest thepotential use of NM as an anti-flavivirus candidate, and a novel drug designapproach targeting the flavivirus envelope protein.

TI  - Early infection of Zika virus in the male reproductive system of AG129 mice:molecular and immunohistochemical evaluation.
LID - 10.1007/s42770-022-00761-x [doi]
AB  - Sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV), an important arbovirus, and the viruspersistence in semen raise several questions about how and where it circulates inthe male reproductive system (MRS). Several studies reported detection of thevirus in testes, epididymis, and prostate at 5 days post-infection (dpi) or more in animal models. In the present study, we investigated the interactions of ZIKV with mouse MRS using the AG129 strain, a ZIKV permissive immunodeficient mousestrain, at two dpi. Viral RNA was detected in blood, testes, epididymis, andprostatic complexes (prostate and seminal vesicles). Immunohistochemical (IHC)analyses, based on the envelope protein, showed an early infection in organs ofMRS since ZIKV positive antigens were detected in cells within or surroundingblood vessels, Sertoli, and germ cells in testes and epithelial cells inepididymis and prostate. Positive antigens for NS5 protein, the virusRNA-dependent RNA polymerase, were also detected by IHC in these organs andcirculating leukocytes, suggesting that the virus replicates in these sites asearly as 2 days post-infection. Analysis of the early stages of ZIKV infection inMRS may improve the current knowledge about this issue and contribute to thedevelopment of therapies directed to the infection at this site.

TI  - Discovery of Bispecific Lead Compounds from Azadirachta indica against ZIKANS2B-NS3 Protease and NS5 RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase Using MolecularSimulations.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has been characterized as one of many potential pathogens andplaced under future epidemic outbreaks by the WHO. However, a lack of potentialtherapeutics can result in an uncontrolled pandemic as with other human pandemic viruses. Therefore, prioritized effective therapeutics development has beenrecommended against ZIKV. In this context, the present study adopted a strategyto explore the lead compounds from Azadirachta indica against ZIKV via concurrentinhibition of the NS2B-NS3 protease (ZIKV(pro)) and NS5 RNA dependent RNApolymerase (ZIKV(RdRp)) proteins using molecular simulations. Initially,structure-based virtual screening of 44 bioflavonoids reported in Azadirachtaindica against the crystal structures of targeted ZIKV proteins resulted in theidentification of the top four common bioflavonoids, viz. Rutin, Nicotiflorin,Isoquercitrin, and Hyperoside. These compounds showed substantial docking energy (-7.9 to -11.01 kcal/mol) and intermolecular interactions with essential residuesof ZIKV(pro) (B:His(51), B:Asp(75), and B:Ser(135)) and ZIKV(RdRp) (Asp(540),Ile(799), and Asp(665)) by comparison to the reference compounds, O7N inhibitor(ZIKV(pro)) and Sofosbuvir inhibitor (ZIKV(RdRp)). Besides, long intervalmolecular dynamics simulation (500 ns) on the selected docked poses revealsstability of the respective docked poses contributed by intermolecular hydrogenbonds and hydrophobic interactions. The predicted complex stability was furthersupported by calculated end-point binding free energy using molecular mechanicsgeneralized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. Consequently, the identifiedcommon bioflavonoids are recommended as promising therapeutic inhibitors ofZIKV(pro) and ZIKV(RdRp) against ZIKV for further experimental assessment.

AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogenic, enveloped,positive-stranded RNA virus in the family Flaviviridae. Structural studies offlavivirus virions have primarily focused on mosquito-borne species, with onlyone cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a tick-borne speciespublished. Here, we present a 3.3 A cryo-EM structure of the TBEV virion of theKuutsalo-14 isolate, confirming the overall organisation of the virus. We observeconformational switching of the peripheral and transmembrane helices of Mprotein, which can explain the quasi-equivalent packing of the viral proteins andhighlights their importance in stabilising membrane protein arrangement in thevirion. The residues responsible for M protein interactions are highly conserved in TBEV but not in the structurally studied Hypr strain, nor in mosquito-borneflaviviruses. These interactions may compensate for the lower number of hydrogen bonds between E proteins in TBEV compared to the mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Thestructure reveals two lipids bound in the E protein which are important for virusassembly. The lipid pockets are comparable to those recently described inmosquito-borne Zika, Spondweni, Dengue, and Usutu viruses. Our results thusadvance the understanding of tick-borne flavivirus architecture andvirion-stabilising interactions.

TI  - Aedes aegypti Shows Increased Susceptibility to Zika Virus via Both In Vitro and In Vivo Models of Type II Diabetes.
LID - 665 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040665 [doi]
AB  - Chronic conditions like type II diabetes (T2DM) have long been known toexacerbate many infectious diseases. For many arboviruses, including Zika virus(ZIKV), severe outcomes, morbidity and mortality usually only occur in patientswith such pre-existing conditions. However, the effects of T2DM and otherpre-existing conditions on human blood (e.g., hypo/hyperinsulinemia,hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia) that may impact infectivity of arboviruses for vectors is largely unexplored. We investigated whether the susceptibility ofAedes aegypti mosquitoes was affected when the mosquitoes fed on "diabetic"bloodmeals, such as bloodmeals composed of artificially glycosylated erythrocytesor those from viremic, diabetic mice (LEPRDB/DB). Increasing glycosylation oferythrocytes from hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) values of 5.5-5.9 to 6.2 increased the infection rate of a Galveston, Texas strain of Ae. aegypti to ZIKV strainPRVABC59 at a bloodmeal titer of 4.14 log10 FFU/mL from 0.0 to 40.9 and 42.9%,respectively. ZIKV was present in the blood of viremic LEPRDB/DB mice at similar levels as isogenic control C57BL/6J mice (3.3 log10 FFU/mL and 3.6 log10 FFU/mL, respectively. When mice sustained a higher ZIKV viremia of 4.6 log10 FFU/mL,LEPRDB/DB mice infected 36.3% of mosquitoes while control C57BL/6J mice with aviremia of 4.2 log10 FFU/mL infected only 4.1%. Additionally, when highlysusceptible Ae. aegypti Rockefeller mosquitoes fed on homozygous LEPRDB/DB,heterozygous LEPRWT/DB, and control C57BL/6J mice with viremias of approximately 4 log10 FFU/mL, 54%, 15%, and 33% were infected, respectively. In total, thesedata suggest that the prevalence of T2DM in a population may have a significantimpact on ZIKV transmission and indicates the need for further investigation ofthe impacts of pre-existing metabolic conditions on arbovirus transmission.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14040738 [doi]
AB  - Viral disease outbreaks affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide andremain a serious threat to global health. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic andother recent geographically- confined viral outbreaks (severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS), Ebola, dengue, zika and ever-recurring seasonal influenza), alsowith devastating tolls at sanitary and socio-economic levels, are soberingreminders in this respect. Among the respective pathogenic agents, Zika virus(ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquito vectors and causing the eponymous fever, isparticularly insidious in that infection during pregnancy results incomplications such as foetal loss, preterm birth or irreversible brainabnormalities, including microcephaly. So far, there is no effective remedy forZIKV infection, mainly due to the limited ability of antiviral drugs to crossblood-placental and/or blood-brain barriers (BPB and BBB, respectively). Despite its restricted permeability, the BBB is penetrable by a variety of molecules,mainly peptide-based, and named BBB peptide shuttles (BBBpS), able to ferryvarious payloads (e.g., drugs, antibodies, etc.) into the brain. Recently, wehave described peptide-porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) as successful BBBpS-associateddrug leads for HIV, an enveloped virus in which group ZIKV also belongs. Herein, we report on several brain-directed, low-toxicity PPCs capable of targeting ZIKV.One of the conjugates, PP-P1, crossing both BPB and BBB, has shown to beeffective against ZIKV (IC50 1.08 microM) and has high serum stability (t1/2 ca. 22 h) without altering cell viability at all tested concentrations.Peptide-porphyrin conjugation stands out as a promising strategy to fill the ZIKVtreatment gap.

AB  - A successful human pregnancy requires precisely timed adaptations by the maternalimmune system to support fetal growth while simultaneously protecting mother and fetus against microbial challenges. The first trimester of pregnancy ischaracterized by a robust increase in innate immune activity that promotessuccessful implantation of the blastocyst and placental development. Moreover,early pregnancy is also a state of increased vulnerability to verticallytransmitted pathogens notably, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika virus(ZIKV), SARS-CoV-2, and Listeria monocytogenes. As gestation progresses, thesecond trimester is marked by the establishment of an immunosuppressiveenvironment that promotes fetal tolerance and growth while preventing pretermbirth, spontaneous abortion, and other gestational complications. Finally, theperiod leading up to labor and parturition is characterized by the reinstatement of an inflammatory milieu triggering childbirth. These dynamic waves of carefullyorchestrated changes have been dubbed the "immune clock of pregnancy." Monocytes in maternal circulation and tissue-resident macrophages at the maternal-fetalinterface play a critical role in this delicate balance. This review willsummarize the current data describing the longitudinal changes in the phenotypeand function of monocyte and macrophage populations in healthy and complicatedpregnancies.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vector-borne diseases represent a huge globalburden impacting health systems. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviraldiseases including dengue, Zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever in bothtropical and subtropical areas. Ethnopharmacological investigations providepotential avenues for developing new vector control strategies. AIM OF THE STUDY:The objective of this study is to document the Sao Sebastiao de Marinau riversidecommunity's ethnoknowledge of local plants used to control mosquitoes and performbioguided fractionation to isolate the compounds active against the arboviraldisease vector Ae. aegypti. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviewswere conducted with residents of the Marinau community located in the CaxiuanaNational Forest, in the Amazon biome, Para, Brazil. The plants used to controlmosquitoes were subjected to phytochemical studies guided by Ae. aegypti assays. Extracts were obtained from seven species using distinct organic solvents. Activeextracts and fractions were separated by chromatographic techniques. Isolatedcompounds were characterized by NMR, LC/MS and GC/MS. Sample activity against Ae.aegypti larvae and pupae was evaluated after 24, 48 and 72 h exposure. Theextracts were also investigated against adult female mosquitoes. The LC50 values were determined by diluting each sample to obtain different concentrations in therespective activity range. RESULTS: The Marinau community uses more than tenplants as a repellent, most of which are trees native to the region. The primary applications of these plants to protect against insect bites were: burning plants(fumigation), application of body oils and bathing in macerated plants. Carapaguianensis is the predominant species used as a repellent. Extracts fromDiospyros guianensis fruits, Carapa guianensis seed shells and Aspidospermanitidum wood demonstrated Ae. aegypti larvicidal activity. The C. guianensis seedshell extract demonstrated a residual larvicidal effect. Plumbagin, stigmasterol,beta-sitosterol, betulinic, ursolic and oleanolic acids, and betulin wereidentified in the D. guianensis extract. The plumbagin, ursolic and oleanolicacids displayed larvicidal activity. Oleanolic, ursolic and betulinic acids, and betulin were considered pupicidal. Aricine, the major alkaloid isolated from A.nitidum wood, also presented larvicidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: Ten plant species traditionally used by the Marinau community to afford protection againstmosquitoes were reported. C. guianensis, D. guianensis and A. nitidum extractswere considered larvicidal against Ae. aegypti. Four triterpenes stood out asvery active compounds against pupae. Aricine, an indole alkaloid, displayedlarvicidal activity. Therefore, traditional knowledge of Amazonian plantscombined with bioguided fractionation constitutes a strategy for the development of eco-friendly insecticides to control Ae. aegypti, an arbovirus vector.

PG  - e0257408
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0257408 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense RNA flavivirus and can cause seriousneurological disorders including microcephaly in infected fetuses. As amosquito-borne arbovirus, it enters the bloodstream and replicates in variousorgans. During pregnancy, it can be transmitted from the blood of the viremicmother to the fetus by crossing the placental barrier. Monocytes and macrophages are considered the earliest blood cell types to be infected by ZIKV. As a firstline defense, these cells are crucial components in innate immunity and hostresponses and may impact viral pathogenesis in humans. Previous studies haveshown that ZIKV infection can activate inflammasomes and induce proinflammatorycytokines in monocytes. In this report, we showed that ZIKV could infect andinduce cell death in human and murine macrophages. In addition to the presence ofcleaved caspase-3, indicating that apoptosis was involved, we identified thecleaved caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) as well as increased secretion ofIL-1beta and IL-18. This suggests that the inflammasome was activated and thatmay lead to pyroptosis in infected macrophages. The pyroptosis wasNLRP3-dependent and could be suppressed in the macrophages treated with shRNA to target and knockdown caspase-1. It was also be inhibited by an inhibitor forcaspase-1, indicating that the pyroptosis was triggered via a canonical approach.Our findings in this study demonstrate a concomitant occurrence of apoptosis and pyroptosis in ZIKV-infected macrophages, with two mechanisms involved in the celldeath, which may have potentially significant impacts on viral pathogenesis inhumans.

AB  - A Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can result in severe birth defectssuch as microcephaly. To date, it is incompletely understood how ZIKV can crossthe human placenta. Furthermore, results from studies in pregnant mice andnon-human primates are conflicting regarding the role of cross-reactive denguevirus (DENV) antibodies on transplacental ZIKV transmission. Elucidating how ZIKVcan cross the placenta and which risk factors contribute to this is important forrisk assessment and for potential intervention strategies for transplacental ZIKVtransmission. In this study we use an ex vivo human placental perfusion model to study transplacental ZIKV transmission and the effect that cross-reactive DENVantibodies have on this transmission. By using this model, we demonstrate thatDENV antibodies significantly increase ZIKV uptake in perfused human placentasand that this increased uptake is neonatal Fc-receptor-dependent. Furthermore, weshow that cross-reactive DENV antibodies enhance ZIKV infection in term humanplacental explants and in primary fetal macrophages but not in primarytrophoblasts. Our data supports the hypothesis that presence of cross-reactiveDENV antibodies could be an important risk factor for transplacental ZIKVtransmission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ex vivo placental perfusionmodel is a relevant and animal friendly model to study transplacental pathogentransmission.

AB  - Pregnant women and their infants are at high risk to develop a severe COVID-19,with increased rates of hospitalisation to intensive care units, need formechanical ventilation and mortality. Preterm birth, fetal vascular malperfusion,and premature rupture of membrane have been the most reported adverse pregnancyoutcomes and these effects have been especially associated with the onset of the disease at early gestational age. The early expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 inhuman embryos has been proven, determining an increased susceptibility toSARS-CoV-2. Preterm infants born to women infected by SARS-CoV-2 have a higherrisk of need for specialist neonatal care with prolonged hospitalization.Moreover, inflammation of developing embryos could cause long-term defects,regardless of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Due to Maternal ImmuneActivation (MIA), in utero inflammation is associated with neurodevelopmental,cognitive and psychiatric disorders in affected offspring. Despite risks thatCOVID-19 could induce in pregnancy, there are not many published data describing the safety and/or efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women, commonly notincluded in vaccine research. The evidence from the few pregnant womenunintentionally enrolled in clinical trials and vaccinated suggests that COVID-19vaccines, both based on mRNA and viral vectors, do not pose significant risks to the fetus or breastfeeding infants. Moreover, human studies using mRNA-basedvaccines against Zika virus, influenza, and rabies have reported good safety and immunogenicity during pregnancy. In this review, we evaluate the role of COVID-19in adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and the need to vaccinate pregnantwomen.

AB  - In a previous publication, I stressed the fundamental importance of research for improving health using as an example the control of Chagas disease in theAmericas.(1) For that purpose, I analysed the major scientific breakthroughs and public health events from the 1909 discovery of Chagas disease and its causative pathogen, Trypanosoma cruzi, by Carlos Chagas,(2) through the successful control of its transmission by insect vectors in large regions of the Southern Conecountries in the 90s.(3) In the twenty years since that publication, Brazil andLatin American countries had to cope with a number of serious public healththreats, old and new: (i) recrudescence of well-known diseases, such as dengueand yellow fever; (ii) emergence of viral diseases that had been restricted toother continents (Zika, Chikungunya); (iii) new epidemics (H1N1) or (iv)pandemics (COVID-19). Are there still some lessons from that success storyagainst a neglected disease of the 90s that would be relevant today in thecontext of these recent challenges?

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as asignificant public health concern owing to its association with congenitalabnormalities and severe neurological sequelae. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic approaches to efficiently treat ZIKV infections.This study used phenotypic screening to identify a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazolederivatives that possess antiviral activity against ZIKV infection. Subsequently,28 new derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for this purpose.Among these compounds,4-(5-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)aniline (5d) had potentantiviral activity against ZIKV infections. Furthermore, a structure-activityrelationship analysis indicated that a benzyl substitution on the anilinenitrogen of this compound improved potency while augmenting its drug-likeproperties. In addition, 5d exhibited antiviral activity against various viruses of Flaviviridae family of worldwide public health importance, such as dengue,Japanese encephalitis and classical swine fever viruses, indicating its potentialas a lead compound for generating 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives withbroad-spectrum anti-flaviviral properties.

TI  - Urological outcomes in children with congenital Zika syndrome: The experience of a cohort in Campina Grande, Brazil.
PG  - 583-591
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13754 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the urological outcomes in children with congenital Zikasyndrome (CZS) and investigate the relationship between clinical and urologicalfindings in this population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involvedchildren with CZS followed up by a referral centre for children with microcephalyin the state of Paraiba in northeast Brazil. The urological evaluation includedclinical history, urine culture results, ultrasonography of the urinary tract,and urodynamic evaluation, following the protocol proposed by Costa Monteiro etal. (2017). Descriptive statistical analysis was performed in addition toassociation and correlation tests, considering clinical and urodynamic variables.RESULTS: Among the 88 children with CZS (35.5 +/- 5.5 months), 97.7% hadmicrocephaly, and 51% presented urinary tract infection (UTI) confirmed withclinical history and lab tests. The number of confirmed UTI episodes varied from one to 14 per child. The urodynamic evaluation confirmed the presence of anoveractive bladder in 78 children and incomplete voiding in 50. Urodynamicfindings were associated with the number of confirmed UTI episodes, child's sex, and actual weight, in addition to the use of anticonvulsant and myorelaxantdrugs. CONCLUSIONS: UTIs were confirmed in most children. Other urologicaloutcomes observed were overactive bladder and low bladder capacity, which wereassociated with the number of confirmed UTI episodes, use of anticonvulsants and myorelaxants, and the child's sex and weight. These are treatable conditions, andit is paramount that paediatricians, neonatologists, and infectious diseasespecialists are aware of them to make clinical decisions and help reduce the riskof renal damage and other morbidities.

AB  - Identification and classification of high-risk areas for the presence of Aedesaegypti is not an easy task. To develop suitable methods to identify this areasis an essential task that will increase the efficiency and effectiveness ofcontrol measures and to optimize the use of resources. The objectives of thisstudy were to identify high- risk areas for the presence of Ae. aegypti usingmosquito traps and household visits to identify breeding sites; to identify andvalidate aspects of the remote sensing images that could characterize theseareas; to evaluate the relationship between this spatial risk classification and the occurrence of Ae. aegypti; and provide a methodology to the health andcontrol vector services and prioritize these areas for development of controlmeasure. Information about the geographical coordinates of these traps willenable us to apply the kriging spatial analysis tool to generate maps with thepredicted numbers of Ae. aegypti. Satellite images were used to identify thecharacteristic features the four areas, so that other areas could also beclassified using only the sensing remote images. The developed methodologyenables the identification of high-risk areas for Ae. aegypti and for theoccurrence of Dengue, as well as Zika fever and Chikungunya fever using onlysensing remote images. These results allow health and vector control services to prioritize these areas for developing surveillance and control measures. The use of the available resources can be optimized and potentially promote a decrease inthe expected incidences of these diseases, particularly Dengue.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause devastating effects in the unborn fetus of pregnantwomen. To develop a candidate vaccine that can protect human fetuses, wegenerated a panel of live measles vaccine (MV) vectors expressing ZIKV-E and-NS1. Our MV-based ZIKV-E vaccine, MV-E2, protected mice from the non-lethal ZikaAsian strain (PRVABC59) and the lethal African strain (MR766) challenge. Despite 100% survival of the MV-E2 mice, however, complete viral clearance was notachieved in the brain and reproductive tract of the lethally challenged mice. We then tested MV-based vaccines that expressed E and NS1 together or separately in two different vaccines. We observed complete clearance of ZIKV from the femalereproductive tract and complete fetal protection in the lethal African challenge model in animals that received the dual antigen vaccines. Additionally, MV-E2 andMV-NS1, when administered together, induced durable plasma cell responses. Ourfindings suggest that NS1 antibodies are required to enhance the protection ofZIKV-E antibodies in the female reproductive tract.

AB  - Glycans are among the most important cell molecular components. However, giventheir structural diversity, their functions have not been fully explored.Glycosylation is a vital post-translational modification for various proteins.Many bacteria and viruses rely on N-linked and O-linked glycosylation to perform critical biological functions. The diverse functions of glycosylation on viralproteins during viral infections, including Dengue, Zika, influenza, and humanimmunodeficiency viruses as well as coronaviruses have been reported. N-linkedglycosylation is the most common form of protein modification, and it modulatesfolding, transportation and receptor binding. Compared to N-linked glycosylation,the functions of O-linked viral protein glycosylation have not beencomprehensively evaluated. In this review, we summarize findings on viral proteinglycosylation, with particular attention to studies on N-linked glycosylation in viral life cycles. This review informs the development of virus-specific vaccinesor inhibitors.

TI  - "One feels anger to know there is no one to help us!". Perceptions of mothers of children with Zika virus-associated microcephaly in Caribbean Colombia: Aqualitative study.
PG  - e0010328
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) was associated with a sudden andunprecedented increase in infants born with microcephaly. Colombia was the secondmost affected country by the epidemic in the Americas. Primary caregivers ofchildren with ZIKV-associated microcephaly, their mothers mainly, were at higher risk of suffering anxiety and depression. Often, these women were stigmatized andabandoned by their partners, relatives, and communities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALFINDINGS: This study aimed to understand the perceptions about ZIKV infectionamong mothers of children born with microcephaly during the ZIKV epidemic inCaribbean Colombia, and the barriers and facilitators affecting child healthfollow-up. An exploratory qualitative study, based on Phenomenology and Grounded Theory, was conducted in Caribbean Colombia. Data were collected through In-DepthInterviews (IDI) from women who delivered a baby with microcephaly during theZIKV epidemic at Clinica Salud Social, Sincelejo, Sucre District (N = 11). Thethemes that emerged during the interviews included experiences from their livesbefore pregnancy; knowledge about ZIKV; experiences and perceptions whendiagnosed; considering a possible termination of pregnancy, and children'sclinical follow-up. In some cases, women reported having been told they werehaving a baby with microcephaly but decided not to terminate the pregnancy; whilein other cases, women found out about their newborn's microcephaly condition onlyat birth. The main barriers encountered by participants during children'sfollow-up included the lack of psychosocial and economic support, thestigmatization and abandonment by some partners and relatives, and thefrustration of seeing the impaired development of their children. CONCLUSIONS:This study contributed to identifying the social, medical, psychological, andeconomic needs of families with children affected by the ZIKV epidemic.Commitment and action by local and national governments, and internationalbodies, is required to ensure sustained and quality health services by affectedchildren and their families.

AB  - The mosquito species Aedes aegypti is the primary transmitter of viruses thatcause endemic diseases like dengue in Pakistan. It is also a cause of othervector-borne diseases like yellow fever, Zika fever, and chikungunya, whichsignificantly impact human health worldwide. In the absence of efficient vaccines(except for yellow fever) or drugs, vector control methods, such as the sterileinsect technique (SIT), have been proposed as additional tools for the managementof these diseases. Mosquito SIT programs are based on the release of sterilemales and it is important female releases to be ideally zero or to be kept at aminimum, since females are the ones that bite, blood-feed and transmit pathogens.Recently, an Ae. aegypti genetic sexing strain (GSS), with and without arecombination-suppressing inversion (Inv35), was developed using the eye color asa selectable marker, with males having black eyes and females red eyes. In thepresent study, we introgressed the sexing features and the Inv35 of the Ae.aegypti red-eye GSS into the Pakistani genomic background aiming to their future use for SIT applications in the country. Both introgressed strains, the Red-eyeGSS-PAK and the Red-eye GSS/Inv35-PAK, were evaluated in respect to their geneticstability and biological quality by assessing parameters like recombination rate,fecundity, fertility, pupal and adult recovery, time of development, pupalweight, survival, and flight ability in comparison with a wild Pakistanipopulation (PAK). The results suggest that the sexing features and therecombination suppression properties of Inv35 were not affected after theirintrogression into the local genomic background; however, some biological traits of the two newly constructed strains were affected, positively or negatively,suggesting that a thorough quality control analysis should be performed after theintrogression of a GSS into a new genomic background prior to its use in SITfield trials or applications. The importance of using GSS with local genomicbackground for SIT applications against Aedes aegypti is also discussed.

AB  - In co-infection models for two diseases, it is mostly claimed that, the dynamicalbehavior of the sub-models usually predict or drive the behavior of the complete models. However, under a certain assumption such as, allowing incidentco-infection with both diseases, we have a different observation. In this paper, a new mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2 and Zika co-dynamics is presented whichincorporates incident co-infection by susceptible individuals. It is worthmentioning that the assumption is missing in many existing co-infection models.We shall discuss the impact of this assumption on the dynamics of a co-infection model. The model also captures sexual transmission of Zika virus. The positivity and boundedness of solution of the proposed model are studied, in addition to thelocal asymptotic stability analysis. The model is shown to exhibit backwardbifurcation caused by the disease-induced death rates and parameters associatedwith susceptibility to a second infection by those singly infected. UsingLyapunov functions, the disease free and endemic equilibria are shown to beglobally asymptotically stable for R 0 1 , respectively. To manage theco-circulation of both infections effectively, under an endemic setting, timedependent controls in the form of SARS-CoV-2, Zika and co-infection preventionstrategies are incorporated into the model. The simulations show that SARS-CoV-2 prevention could greatly reduce the burden of co-infections with Zika.Furthermore, it is also shown that prevention controls for Zika can significantlydecrease the burden of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are emerging and re-emerging across the globe, especiallyafter the COVID19 pandemic. The recent advances in text mining in infectiousdiseases hold the potential of providing timely access to explicit and implicitassociations among information in the text. In the past few years, theavailability of online text data in the form of unstructured or semi-structuredtext with rich content of information from this domain enables many studies toprovide solutions in this area, e.g., disease-related knowledge discovery,disease surveillance, early detection system, etc. However, a recent review oftext mining in the domain of mosquito-borne disease was not available to the bestof our knowledge. In this review, we survey the recent works in the text miningtechniques used in combating mosquito-borne diseases. We highlight the corpussources, technologies, applications, and the challenges faced by the studies,followed by the possible future directions that can be taken further in thisdomain. We present a bibliometric analysis of the 294 scientific articles thathave been published in Scopus and PubMed in the domain of text mining inmosquito-borne diseases, from the year 2016 to 2021. The papers were furtherfiltered and reviewed based on the techniques used to analyze the text related tomosquito-borne diseases. Based on the corpus of 158 selected articles, we found27 of the articles were relevant and used text mining in mosquito-borne diseases.These articles covered the majority of Zika (38.70%), Dengue (32.26%), andMalaria (29.03%), with extremely low numbers or none of the other crucialmosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile fever. Twitter was the dominant corpus resource to perform text mining in mosquito-bornediseases, followed by PubMed and LexisNexis databases. Sentiment analysis was themost popular technique of text mining to understand the discourse of the disease and followed by information extraction, which dependency relation andco-occurrence-based approach to extract relations and events. Surveillance wasthe main usage of most of the reviewed studies and followed by treatment, whichfocused on the drug-disease or symptom-disease association. The advance in textmining could improve the management of mosquito-borne diseases. However, thetechnique and application posed many limitations and challenges, including biaseslike user authentication and language, real-world implementation, etc. Wediscussed the future direction which can be useful to expand this area anddomain. This review paper contributes mainly as a library for text mining inmosquito-borne diseases and could further explore the system for other neglected diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are of notable public health importance worldwide, owing to their potential to cause explosive outbreaks andinduce debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease manifestations. Thissystematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the relationship betweenmarkers of socioeconomic position (SEP) and infection due to arboviruses withmosquito vectors. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Embase,and LILACS databases to identify studies published between 1980 and 2020 thatmeasured the association of SEP markers with arbovirus infection. We includedobservational studies without geographic location or age restrictions. Weexcluded studies from grey literature, reviews and ecological studies. Studyfindings were extracted and summarised, and pooled estimates were obtained using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: We identified 36 observational studiesusing data pertaining to 106 524 study participants in 23 geographic locationsthat empirically examined the relationship between socioeconomic factors andinfections caused by seven arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya, Japaneseencephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Sindbis, West Nile and Zika viruses). Whileresults were varied, descriptive synthesis pointed to a higher risk of arbovirus infection associated with markers of lower SEP, including lower education, incomepoverty, low healthcare coverage, poor housing materials, interrupted watersupply, marital status (married, divorced or widowed), non-white ethnicities and migration status. Pooled crude estimates indicated an increased risk of arboviralinfection associated with lower education (risk ratio, RR 1.5 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9);I(2)=83.1%), interruption of water supply (RR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; I(2)=0.0%) and having been married (RR 1.5 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1; I(2)=85.2%). CONCLUSION:Evidence from this systematic review suggests that lower SEP increases the riskof acquiring arboviral infection; however, there was large heterogeneity acrossstudies. Further studies are required to delineate the relationship betweenspecific individual, household and community-level SEP indicators and arbovirusinfection risks to help inform targeted public health interventions.

AB  - Millingtonia hortensis L.f. and Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz (Bignoniaceae) arenative species from the Asian continent. They are popularly used in traditionalmedicine and their extracts are rich in flavonoids. In this work, ethanolicextracts of stems and leaves of these species were evaluated against theChikungunya, Zika and Mayaro virus. The extracts were subjected to analysis byultra-efficient liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Additionally,M. hortensis leaves extract was fractionated, leading to the isolation ofhispidulin. Anti-arboviral activity against the three viruses was detected for M.hortensis leaves extract with EC50 ranging from 37.8 to 134.1 microg/mL and forO. indicum stems extract with EC50 ranging from 18.6 to 55.9 microg/mL.Hispidulin inhibited viral cytopathic effect of MAYV (EC50 value 32.2 microM) andCHIKV (EC50 value 78.8 microM). In LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis we characterized 25 flavonoids confirming once again the presence of these substances in extracts of these species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Annual outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome pose a major healthburden in India. Although Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounts for around15% of reported cases, the aetiology of most cases remains unknown. We aimed toestablish an enhanced surveillance network and to use a standardised diagnosticalgorithm to conduct a systematic evaluation of acute encephalitis syndrome inIndia. METHODS: In this large-scale, systematic surveillance study in India,patients presenting with acute encephalitis syndrome (ie, acute onset of feverwith altered mental status, seizure, or both) to any of the 18 participatinghospitals across Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Assam were evaluated for JEV(serum and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] IgM ELISA) per standard of care. In enhancedsurveillance, JEV IgM-negative specimens were additionally evaluated for scrubtyphus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus by serum IgM ELISA, and forStreptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, dengue virus, herpes simplex virus, and enterovirus by CSF PCR across five referrallaboratories. In 2017, chikungunya and Leptospira serum IgM by ELISA and Zikavirus serum and CSF by PCR were also tested. FINDINGS: Of 10 107 patients withacute encephalitis syndrome enrolled in enhanced surveillance between Jan 1,2014, and Dec 31, 2017, 5734 (57.8%) of 9917 participants with available datawere male and 6179 (62.7%) of 9856 were children aged 15 years and younger. Amongpatients who provided a sample of either CSF or serum in enhanced surveillance,an aetiology was identified in 1921 (33.2%) of 5786 patients enrolled between2014 and 2016 and in 1484 (34.3%) of 4321 patients enrolled in 2017. The mostcommonly identified aetiologies were JEV (1023 [17.7%] of 5786 patients), scrubtyphus (645 [18.5%] of 3489), and dengue virus (161 [5.2%] of 3124). Amongparticipants who provided both CSF and serum specimens, an aetiology wasidentified in 1446 (38.3%) of 3774 patients enrolled between 2014 and 2016 and in936 (40.3%) of 2324 enrolled in 2017, representing a 3.1-times increase in thenumber of patients with acute encephalitis syndrome with an identified aetiology compared with standard care alone (299 [12.9%]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION:Implementation of a systematic diagnostic algorithm in an enhanced surveillanceplatform resulted in a 3.1-times increase in identification of the aetiology ofacute encephalitis syndrome, besides JEV alone, and highlighted the importance ofscrub typhus and dengue virus as important infectious aetiologies in India. Thesefindings have prompted revision of the national testing guidelines for thissyndrome across India. FUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

TI  - Diagnosis of congenital infections in premature, low-birthweight newborns withintrauterine growth restriction caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplexvirus (HSV), Parvo-B 19, and Zika virus: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1515/jpm-2021-0244 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of viral congenital infections in newbornsclassified as premature, low-birthweight, small for gestational age orintrauterine growth restriction. METHODS: The definition considered for selectingpapers were: P as newborns younger than 28 days; V as low-birthweight,prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction; O as frequency of congenitalinfections with Cytomegalovirus, Parvovirus B19, Herpes Simplex, and Zika virus. The research was performed using EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS and MEDLINE databases,with no limitations on date and language. RESULTS: Eight studies were included.Manuscripts including Herpes Simplex, Zika virus or Parvovirus B19 did notfulfill the defined criteria. A wide variation in the frequency of CMV congenitalinfection (0-4.8%) was found, which might be attributed to regional andmethodological differences between investigations. CONCLUSIONS: Newborncharacteristics associated with CMV congenital infections may directinvestigations towards these patients with a higher probability of infection.However, as data are controversial, studies concerning screening of infection areimportant to define recommendations of diagnosis.

AB  - Saliva from mosquitoes contains vasodilators that antagonize vasoconstrictorsproduced at the bite site. Sialokinin is a vasodilator present in the saliva ofAedes aegypti. Here, we investigate its function and describe its mechanism ofaction during blood feeding. Sialokinin induces nitric oxide release similar tosubstance P. Sialokinin-KO mosquitoes produce lower blood perfusion than parentalmosquitoes at the bite site during probing and have significantly longer probing times, which result in lower blood feeding success. In contrast, there is nodifference in feeding between KO and parental mosquitoes when using artificialmembrane feeders or mice that are treated with a substance P receptor antagonist,confirming that sialokinin interferes with host hemostasis via NK1R signaling.While sialokinin-KO saliva does not affect virus infection in vitro, itstimulates macrophages and inhibits leukocyte recruitment in vivo. This workhighlights the biological functionality of salivary proteins in blood feeding.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are arthropod-borne pathogenicflaviviruses that co-circulate in many countries. To understand some of thepressures that influence ZIKV evolution, we mimic the natural transmission cycle by repeating serial passaging of ZIKV through cultured mosquito cells and either DENV-naive or DENV-immune mice. Compared with wild-type ZIKV, the strainspassaged under both conditions exhibit increased pathogenesis in DENV-immunemice. Application of reverse genetics identifies an isoleucine-to-valine mutation(I39V) in the NS2B proteins of both passaged strains that confers enhancedfitness and escape from pre-existing DENV immunity. Introduction of I39V or I39T,a naturally occurring homologous mutation detected in recent ZIKV isolates,increases the replication of wild-type ZIKV in human neuronal precursor cells andlaboratory-raised mosquitoes. Our data indicate that ZIKV strains with enhancedtransmissibility and pathogenicity can emerge in DENV-naive or -immune settings, and that NS2B-I39 mutants may represent ZIKV variants of interest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guillian Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmunepolyradiculoneuropathy often associated with previous exposure to infectiousagents. METHODS: A clinical cohort of 41 patients with GBS admitted to the BaseHospital Institute of the Federal District between May 2017 and April 2019 wasfollowed up for 1 year. Serological tests for arbovirus detection andamplification of nucleic acids using polymerase chain reaction for zika virus(ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were performed.RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 61% men with a median age of 40 years, and 83%had GBS-triggering events. A total of 54% had Grade 4 disability, 17% had Grade3, 12% had Grade 2, 10% had Grade 5, and 7% had Grade 1. The classic formoccurred in 83% of patients. Nerve conduction evaluations revealed acutedemyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (51%), acute motor axonal neuropathy(17%), acute sensory-motor neuropathy (15%), and indeterminate forms (17%). Four patients were seropositive for DENV. There was no laboratory detection of ZIKV orCHIKV infection. Ninety percent of patients received human immunoglobulin.Intensive care unit admission occurred in 17.1% of the patients, and mechanicalventilation was used in 14.6%. One patient died of Bickerstaff's encephalitis.Most patients showed an improvement in disability at 10 weeks of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: GBS in the Federal District showed a variable clinical spectrum, andit was possible to detect recent exposure to DENV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In July 2021, an outbreak of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was reportedin a rural region of Maharashtra state, India. METHODS: Serum samples ofsymptomatic cases (n=33) were screened for dengue virus (DENV), CHIKV and Zikavirus (ZIKV) by molecular and serological assays. RESULTS: The first case of ZIKVinfection from Maharashtra was detected and confirmed by molecular andserological assays. Complete genome sequencing revealed that the ZIKV sequencebelongs to the Asian genotype and had a closer homology with pre-epidemic strainspresent before 2007. CONCLUSIONS: ZIKV surveillance needs to be strengthened inthe regions experiencing dengue and chikungunya outbreaks.

TI  - Cross-tissue and generation predictability of relative Wolbachia densities in themosquito Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 128
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05231-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The insect endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is being deployed infield populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypti for biological control. Thismicrobe prevents the replication of human disease-causing viruses inside thevector, including dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Relative Wolbachia densities may in part predict the strength of this 'viral blocking' effect. Additionally,Wolbachia densities may affect the strength of the reproductive manipulations it induces, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), maternal inheritance ratesor induced fitness effects in the insect host. High rates of CI and maternalinheritance and low rates of fitness effects are also key to the successfulspreading of Wolbachia through vector populations and its successful use inbiocontrol. The factors that control Wolbachia densities are not completelyunderstood. METHODS: We used quantitative PCR-based methods to estimate relative density of the Wolbachia wAlbB strain in both the somatic and reproductivetissues of adult male and female mosquitoes, as well as in eggs. Usingcorrelation analyses, we assessed whether densities in one tissue predict thosein others within the same individual, but also across generations. RESULTS: Wefound little relationship among the relative Wolbachia densities of differenttissues in the same host. The results also show that there was very littlerelationship between Wolbachia densities in parents and those in offspring, both in the same and different tissues. The one exception was with ovary-eggrelationships, where there was a strong positive association. Relative Wolbachia densities in reproductive tissues were always greater than those in the somatictissues. Additionally, the densities were consistent in females over theirlifetime regardless of tissue, whereas they were generally higher and morevariable in males, particularly in the testes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that either stochastic processes or local tissue-based physiologies are morelikely factors dictating Wolbachia densities in Ae. aegypti individuals, ratherthan shared embryonic environments or heritable genetic effects of the mosquitogenome. These findings have implications for understanding how relative Wolbachiadensities may evolve and/or be maintained over the long term in Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Zika Virus Induces Mitotic Catastrophe in Human Neural Progenitors by Triggering Unscheduled Mitotic Entry in the Presence of DNA Damage While FunctionallyDepleting Nuclear PNKP.
PG  - e0033322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00333-22 [doi]
AB  - Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) leads with high frequency tocongenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose worst outcome is microcephaly. However, themechanisms of congenital ZIKV neurodevelopmental pathologies, including directcytotoxicity to neural progenitor cells (NPC), placental insufficiency, andimmune responses, remain incompletely understood. At the cellular level,microcephaly typically results from death or insufficient proliferation of NPC orcortical neurons. NPC replicate fast, requiring efficient DNA damage responses toensure genome stability. Like congenital ZIKV infection, mutations in thepolynucleotide 5'-kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) gene, which encodes a critical DNAdamage repair enzyme, result in recessive syndromes often characterized bycongenital microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ). We thus tested whether there wereany links between ZIKV and PNKP. Here, we show that two PNKP phosphataseinhibitors or PNKP knockout inhibited ZIKV replication. PNKP relocalized from thenucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, colocalizing with the marker of ZIKV replication factories (RF) NS1 and resulting in functional nuclear PNKPdepletion. Although infected NPC accumulated DNA damage, they failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. ZIKV also induced activation of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 complexes, which trigger unscheduled mitotic entry.Inhibition of CDK1 activity inhibited ZIKV replication and the formation of RF,supporting a role of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 in RF morphogenesis. In brief, ZIKVinfection induces mitotic catastrophe resulting from unscheduled mitotic entry inthe presence of DNA damage. PNKP and CycA/CDK1 are thus host factorsparticipating in ZIKV replication in NPC, and pathogenesis to neural progenitorcells. IMPORTANCE The 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil andsubsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKVinfection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up tomicrocephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKVoutbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future onespose a serious ongoing risk. However, the cellular and molecular mechanismsresulting in microcephaly remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that ZIKVinfection of neuronal progenitor cells results in cytoplasmic sequestration of anessential DNA repair protein itself associated with microcephaly, with theconsequent accumulation of DNA damage, together with an unscheduled activation ofcytoplasmic CDK1/Cyclin A complexes in the presence of DNA damage. Thesealterations result in mitotic catastrophe of neuronal progenitors, which wouldlead to a depletion of cortical neurons during development.

AB  - Flaviviruses, including Dengue virus, Zika virus, Yellow fever virus, Japaneseencephalitis virus, West Nile virus, cause thousands of deaths and millions ofillnesses each year. The large outbreak of ZIKV in 2016 reminds us thatflaviviruses can pose a serious threat to human safety and public health asemerging and re-emerging viruses. However, there are no specific drugs approvedfor the treatment of flavivirus infections. Due to no need to enter the cells,viral entry inhibitors have the unique advantage in suppressing viral infections.Flaviviruses bind to receptors and attach to the cell surface, then enter theendosome in a clathrin-dependent manner and finalizes the viral entry processafter fusion with the cell membrane in a low pH environment. Small molecules,antibodies or peptides can inhibit flavivirus entry by targeting the aboveprocesses. Here, we focus on flavivirus entry inhibitors with well-defined targetand antiviral activity. We hope that our review will provide a theoretical basis for flavivirus treatment and drug research and help to accelerate the clinicalapplication of flavivirus entry inhibitors.

TI  - Co-circulation of Chikungunya Virus during the 2015-2017 Zika Virus Outbreak inPernambuco, Brazil: An Analysis of the Microcephaly Epidemic Research GroupPregnancy Cohort.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0449 [doi]
LID - tpmd210449 [pii]
AB  - Co-circulation of arthropod-borne viruses, particularly those with sharedmosquito vectors like Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV), is increasinglyreported. An accurate differential diagnosis between ZIKV and CHIKV is of highclinical importance, especially in the context of pregnancy, but remainschallenging due to limitations in the availability of specialized laboratorytesting facilities. Using data collected from the prospective pregnancy cohortstudy of the Microcephaly Epidemic Research Group, which followed up pregnantpersons with rash during the peak and decline of the 2015-2017 ZIKV epidemic inRecife, Pernambuco, Brazil, this study aims to describe the geographic andtemporal distribution of ZIKV and CHIKV infections and to investigate the extent to which ZIKV and CHIKV infections may be clinically differentiable. BetweenDecember 2015 and June 2017, we observed evidence of co-circulation withlaboratory confirmation of 213 ZIKV mono-infections, 55 CHIKV mono-infections,and 58 sequential ZIKV/CHIKV infections (i.e., cases with evidence of acute ZIKV infection with concomitant serological evidence of recent CHIKV infection). Inlogistic regressions with adjustment for maternal age, ZIKV mono-infected caseshad lower odds than CHIKV mono-infected cases of presenting with arthralgia (aOR,99% CI: 0.33, 0.15-0.74), arthritis (0.35, 0.14-0.85), fatigue (0.40, 0.17-0.96),and headache (0.44, 0.19-1.90). However, sequential ZIKV/CHIKV infectionscomplicated discrimination, as they did not significantly differ in clinicalpresentation from CHIKV mono-infections. These findings suggest clinical symptomsalone may be insufficient for differentiating between ZIKV and CHIKV infectionsduring pregnancy and therefore laboratory diagnostics continue to be a valuabletool for tailoring care in the event of arboviral co-circulation.

TI  - Seroprevalence of IgG Antibodies Against Multiple Arboviruses in Bats fromCameroon, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
PG  - 252-262
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2021.0076 [doi]
AB  - Background: Emergence of mosquito-borne arboviruses has caused significant publichealth burden. The life cycle of arboviruses comprises sylvatic and urban cycles,including a wildlife reservoir, a human host, and an arthropod vector. However,many questions remain on the sylvatic cycles of arboviruses. In this study, weinvestigate the prevalence of IgG antibodies to arboviruses of public healthimportance in African bats. Material and Methods: We collected dried blood spots from bats in Cameroon, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Todetect IgG antibodies to 10 antigens of 6 arboviruses (Dengue, Zika, West Nile,Usutu, Chikungunya, and O'nyong nyong viruses), we adapted a previously validatedmultiplex detection assay based on the Luminex technology. Results: We testedsamples from 2579 bats, representing 1917 frugivorous and 641 insectivorous bats distributed in 7 families and 21 species. Overall, 218/2579 (8.45%) bat samplesreacted with at least 1 of the 10 antigens tested. The highest prevalence wasobserved against Usutu virus with 2.3% (59/2579), followed by 1.9% (49/2579) and 1.35% (35/2579) for the Dengue virus serotypes 4 and 3, respectively. The global seroprevalence varied by country and collection site: 11% (151/1376) in Cameroon,3.5% (20/565) in DRC, and 7.3% (47/638) in Guinea. The highest rates wereobserved in Hypsignathus monstrosus (17.9%), Rousettus aegyptiacus (16.4%), andEidolon helvum (10.7%), and in species from the insectivorous Molossidae family(7.8-8.9%). Finally, we observed changes in seroprevalence over the year in E.helvum and H. monstrosus colonies, which could be related to populationstructure. Conclusion: On more than 2500 bat samples tested, we showed variableIgG seroprevalences against multiple arboviruses. Overall, the prevalence of IgG antibodies of 8.45% against arboviruses found in bats suggest that they couldplay a role in arboviruses cycles in the wild, in addition to other animalspecies.

AB  - Among the currently used COVID-19 vaccines, the mRNA-based vaccines drew theinterest of the scientists because of its potent and versatile nature inmitigating the disease efficiently through increased translation as well as therobust modulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses within the host.The naked or lipid encapsulated mRNAs are usually optimized in order to formulatethe vaccine. One of the interesting advantage of using mRNA vaccines is that suchplatform can even be used to mitigate other infectious diseases like influenza,zika, and rabies. However, the leading COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, i.e., mRNA-1273and BNT162b2, have already been noticed to possess around 95% efficacy inprovoking both the humoral and cell mediated immunity against the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, causing the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Has Zika Been Forgotten? Findings From Nationwide Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes,and Mosquito Preventive Practices in Malaysia.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2022.40 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess knowledge and attitudes toward Zikavirus disease (ZVD) as well as mosquito prevention practices in Malaysia at anationwide level. METHODS: Computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) wereconducted between June 2019 and February 2020. RESULTS: There are gaps inknowledge about the symptoms, mode of transmission, and risk of microcephaly. Themean for the Zika-related knowledge score was 5.9 (SD +/- 4.4) out of a possible score of 14. The majority perceived little or no risk of getting ZVD (75.0%) and 75.5% were a little or not at all worried about ZVD. A high proportion reportedthe use of insect sprays or mosquito coils to prevent mosquito bites; however, a relatively lower proportion of people reported fixing mosquito netting on doorsand windows, and using mosquito bed nets. The mean for the mosquito preventionpractices score was 11.9 (SD +/- 4.7) out of a possible score of 27. Importantfactors influencing mosquito prevention practices include household income,environment factors, risk perception, and Zika-related knowledge. CONCLUSION:Zika prevention measures should be targeted in priority toward residents in lowersocioeconomic neighborhoods. Campaigns should focus on messages highlighting the high risk of getting dengue.

AB  - Tripartite motif (TRIM) E3 ligases target specific substrates, including viralproteins, for proteasomal degradation, and are thus essential regulators of theinnate antiviral response. TRIM69 ubiquitinates the non-structural NS3 protein ofDengue virus for its degradation by the host machinery. This antiviral strategyabrogates the immunosuppression mediated by the NS2B-NS3 protease complex. Tounderstand how this host-driven antiviral response against Dengue virus, wesought to define the mode of interaction between human TRIM69 and Dengue NS2B-NS3and the subsequent polyubiquitination of the protease by the E3 ligase. We showthat NS2B-NS3Deltapro is sufficient as a substrate for ubiquitination by TRIM69using ELISA and in vitro assays. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange massspectrometry (HDXMS), we mapped the interface of the interaction between TRIM69and NS2B-NS3Deltapro, and propose a rationale for the binding and subsequentubiquitination process. Furthermore, through sequence analysis, we showed thatthe regions targeted by TRIM69 on the DENV-2 NS3 protease (NS3Deltapro) are well conserved across DENV serotypes and other flaviviruses, including Zika virus,West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Our results show the directinteractions of TRIM69 with viral proteins, provide mechanistic insights at amolecular level, and highlight the functional relevance of TRIM69 interactingwith the Dengue viral protein. Collectively, our findings suggest that TRIM69 mayact as a pan-antiflaviviral restriction factor.

PG  - e0265820
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0265820 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rapid expansion of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has raisedserious public health concerns due to the possibility of misdiagnosis in regions where arboviral diseases are endemic. We performed the first study in northernPeru to describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in febrile patientswith a suspected diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya fever. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: A consecutive cross-sectional study was performed in febrile patientsattending primary healthcare centers from April 2020 through March 2021. Patientsenrolled underwent serum sample collection for the molecular and serologicaldetection of DENV and CHIKV. Also, serological detection of IgM antibodiesagainst SARS-CoV-2 was performed. RESULTS: 464 patients were included during the study period, of which (40.51%) were positive for one pathogen, meanwhile (6.90%)presented co-infections between 2 or more pathogens. The majority of patientswith monoinfections were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM with (73.40%), followed byDENV 18.09% and CHIKV (8.51%). The most frequent co-infection was DENV +SARS-CoV-2 with (65.63%), followed by DENV + CHIKV and DENV + CHIKV + SARS-CoV-2,both with (12.50%). The presence of polyarthralgias in hands (43.75%, p<0.01) andfeet (31.25%, p = 0.05) were more frequently reported in patients with CHIKVmonoinfection. Also, conjunctivitis was more common in patients positive forSARS-CoV-2 IgM (11.45%, p<0.01). The rest of the symptoms were similar among all the study groups. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were frequently detected in acute sera from febrile patients with a clinical suspicion of arboviraldisease. The presence of polyarthralgias in hands and feet may be suggestive ofCHIKV infection. These results reaffirm the need to consider SARS-CoV-2 infectionas a main differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness in arboviruses endemic areas, as well as to consider co-infections between these pathogens.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of exotic arboviruses (dengue, chikungunyaand Zika) in Australia. Once established across much of Australia, this mosquito species remains prevalent in central and northern Queensland. In 2011, Ae.aegypti was re-discovered in the town of Gin Gin, Queensland, by healthauthorities during routine larval surveillance. This town is situated on a major highway that provides a distribution pathway into the highly vulnerable andpopulous region of the state where the species was once common. Following thedetection, larval habitat and adult control activities were conducted as a publichealth intervention to eliminate the Ae. aegypti population and reduce the riskof exotic disease transmission. Importantly, genetic analysis revealed ahomogenous cluster and small effective population vulnerable to an eliminationstrategy. By 2015, adult surveillance revealed the population had expandedthroughout the centre of the town. In response, a collaboration between research agencies and local stakeholders activated a second control program in 2016 thatincluded extensive community engagement, enhanced entomologic surveillance andvector control activities including the targeting of key containers, such asunsealed rainwater tanks. Here we describe a model of the public healthintervention which successfully reduced the Ae. aegypti population belowdetection thresholds, using source reduction, insecticides and novel, intensivegenetic surveillance methods. This outcome has important implications for future elimination work in small towns in regions sub-optimal for Ae. aegypti presenceand reinforces the longstanding benefits of a partnership model for publichealth-based interventions for invasive urban mosquito species.

AB  - Structural genomics involves the advent of three-dimensional structures of thegenome encoded proteins through various techniques available. Numerous structuralgenomics research groups have been developed across the globe and they contributeenormously to the identification of three-dimensional structures of variousproteins. In this review, we have discussed the applications of the structuralgenomics approach towards the discovery of potential lead-like molecules against the genomic drug targets of three vector-borne diseases, namely, Dengue,Chikungunya and Zika. Currently, all these three diseases are associated with themost important global public health problems and significant economic burden intropical countries. Structural genomics has accelerated the identification ofnovel drug targets and inhibitors for the treatment of these diseases. We startwith the current development status of the drug targets and antiviral drugsagainst these three diseases and conclude by describing challenges that need tobe addressed to overcome the shortcomings in the process of drug discovery.

AB  - Infectious virus outbreaks pose a significant challenge to public healthcaresystems. Early and accurate virus diagnosis is critical to prevent the spread of the virus, especially when no specific vaccine or effective medicine isavailable. In clinics, the most commonly used viral detection methods aremolecular techniques that involve the measurement of nucleic acids or proteinsbiomarkers. However, most clinic-based methods require complex infrastructure andexpensive equipment, which are not suitable for low-resource settings. Over thepast years, smartphone-based point-of-care testing (POCT) has rapidly emerged as a potential alternative to laboratory-based clinical diagnosis. This reviewsummarizes the latest development of virus detection. First, laboratory-based andPOCT-based viral diagnostic techniques are compared, both of which rely onimmunosensing and nucleic acid detection. Then, various smartphone-based POCTdiagnostic techniques, including optical biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and other types of biosensors are discussed. Moreover, this review covers thedevelopment of smartphone-based POCT diagnostics for various viruses includingCOVID-19, Ebola, influenza, Zika, HIV, et al. Finally, the prospects andchallenges of smartphone-based POCT diagnostics are discussed. It is believedthat this review will aid researchers better understand the current challengesand prospects for achieving the ultimate goal of containing disease-causingviruses worldwide.

TI  - Fitness Cost of Sequential Selection with Deltamethrin in Aedes aegypti (Diptera:Culicidae).
PG  - 930-939
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac032 [doi]
AB  - In Mexico, Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary dengue vector, chikungunya, and Zikaviruses. The continued use of synthetic pyrethroids has led to the development ofresistance in target populations, which has diminished the effectiveness ofvector control programs. Resistance has been associated with disadvantages thataffect the biological parameters of resistant mosquitoes compared to susceptible ones. In the present study, the disadvantages were evaluated by parametersrelated to survival and reproduction ('fitness cost') after selection withdeltamethrin for five generations. The parameters analyzed were the length of thedevelopment cycle, sex ratio, survival, longevity, fecundity, egg viability,preoviposition, oviposition and postoviposition periods, and growth parameters.In the deltamethrin-selected strain, there was a decrease in the developmentcycle duration, the percentage of pupae, the oviposition period, and eggsviability. Although mean daily fecundity was not affected after the selectionprocess, this, together with the decrease in the survival and fecundity levels byspecific age, significantly affected the gross reproductive rate (GRR), netreproductive rate (Ro), and intrinsic growth rate (rm) of the group selected for five generations with deltamethrin compared to the group without selection.Identifying the 'cost' of resistance in biological fitness represents anadvantage if it is desired to limit the spread of resistant populations since thefitness cost is the less likely that resistant individuals will spread in thepopulation. This represents an important factor to consider in designingintegrated vector management programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE.: To describe the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceptionsabout Zika in women of childbearing age (WCA) in the department of Amazonas inPeru, following a Zika outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Descriptive study with amixed quantitative-qualitative approach. We carried out stratified sampling, byapplying a survey to a sample of 723 WCA aged 15 to 49 years in the district ofBagua, department of Amazonas, then we carried out four focus groups with 35 WCA in each group. Frequencies and the grounded theory were used for quantitative andqualitative analysis respectively. Interpretation of both methods was integrated using a narrative approach. RESULTS.: We found that 86.3% of WCA knew that it is possible to get sick with Zika, 10.1% knew that it is transmitted through sexual intercourse, 2.2% knew that it can be transmitted during pregnancy and 68.5%consider that the information is insufficient. In practice, 60% (n=434) usedmosquito nets, 53.4% (n=386) covered water containers and 7.3% (n=4) perceivedlocal government involvement. Qualitative data showed distrust of vector control and expressed the need for psychological support for pregnant women and theirfamilies. CONCLUSIONS.: There are gaps in the knowledge and practices of WCAregarding the prevention of sexual and vertical transmission of Zika; WCAdistrust vector control, do not perceive local government involvement, suggestpsychological support should be provided to pregnant women with Zika, as well as to mothers with disabled children, and wish to access more information aboutZika.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2016, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)was declared in response to the rise of microcephaly cases among newborns inNortheastern Brazil. A common reactionary measure by public health authoritieswas to recommend women postpone pregnancy to avoid the possible perinataltransmission of Zika virus (ZIKV). METHODS: The purpose of this study was toassess how women in Fortaleza, Brazil conceptualize pregnancy; experiencefacilitators and barriers to pregnancy avoidance; perceive the authorities'recommendation to postpone pregnancy due to the ZIKV outbreak; and recall theirexperiences during the ZIKV epidemic. Qualitative methods, specifically a RapidAnthropological Assessment (RAA), were utilized in this study. Data collectionincluded semi-structured interviews, triangulated with observations and informal interviews with community members. RESULTS: The sample included 35 women (18-39years old) who exclusively utilized the national public health care system.Findings indicated that all participants perceived the ZIKVpregnancy-postponement recommendation to be counter-cultural to Brazilian social norms. Overall women's self-perceived agency to prevent pregnancy was low due to social expectations and lack of trust for contraceptives. ZIKV prevention was notseen as a reason to utilize contraceptives. Interestingly, only women whoself-perceived as more affluent were willing to attempt pregnancy prevention for educational, occupational, or financial opportunity. CONCLUSION: Pregnancypostponement as a response to a ZIKV epidemic ignores gaps in reproductive agencyand defies social norms, making it unrealistic and counter-cultural. Future ZIKV health recommendations must be culturally aligned with the population, andaddress barriers and motivators for family planning.

AB  - The mechanisms by which vertically transmitted Zika virus (ZIKV) causes postnatalbrain development abnormalities and congenital disease remain poorly understood. Here, we optimized the established anti-IFNAR1 treated, Rag1(-/-) (AIR) mousemodel of ZIKV infection to examine the consequence of vertical transmission onneonate survival and postnatal brain development. We found that modulating theinfectious dose and the frequency of anti-IFNAR1 treatment of pregnant mice(termed AIR(low) mice) prolonged neonatal survival allowing for pathogenesisstudies of brain tissues at critical postnatal time points. Postnatal AIR(low)mice all had chronic ZIKV infection in the brain that was associated withdecreased cortical thickness and cerebellar volume, increased gliosis, and higherlevels of cell death in many brain areas including cortex, hippocampus andcerebellum when compared to controls. Interestingly, despite active infection andbrain abnormalities, the neurodevelopmental program remained active in AIR(low)mice as indicated by elevated mRNA expression of critical neurodevelopmentalgenes in the brain and enlargement of neural-progenitor rich regions of thecerebellum at a developmental time point analogous to birth in humans.Nevertheless, around the developmental time point when the brain is fullypopulated by neurons, AIR(low) mice developed neurologic disease associated with persistent ZIKV infection in the brain, gliosis, and increased cell death.Together, these data show that vertically transmitted ZIKV infection in the brainof postnatal AIR(low) mice strongly influences brain development resulting instructural abnormalities and cell death in multiple regions of the brain.

PG  - e1010411
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010411 [doi]
AB  - The recent global Zika epidemics have revealed the significant threat thatmosquito-borne viruses pose. There are currently no effective vaccines orprophylactics to prevent Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Limiting exposure toinfected mosquitoes is the best way to reduce disease incidence. Recent studieshave focused on targeting mosquito reproduction and immune responses to reducetransmission. Previous work has evaluated the effect of insulin signaling onantiviral JAK/STAT and RNAi in vector mosquitoes. Specifically, insulin-fedmosquitoes resulted in reduced virus replication in an RNAi-independent,ERK-mediated JAK/STAT-dependent mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate thattargeting insulin signaling through the repurposing of small molecule drugsresults in the activation of both RNAi and JAK/STAT antiviral pathways.ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti were fed blood containing demethylasterriquinone B1(DMAQ-B1), a potent insulin mimetic, in combination with AKT inhibitor VIII.Activation of this coordinated response additively reduced ZIKV levels in Aedesaegypti. This effect included a quantitatively greater reduction in salivarygland ZIKV levels up to 11 d post-bloodmeal ingestion, relative to single pathwayactivation. Together, our study indicates the potential for field delivery ofthese small molecules to substantially reduce virus transmission from mosquito tohuman. As infections like Zika virus are becoming more burdensome and prevalent, understanding how to control this family of viruses in the insect vector is animportant issue in public health.

AB  - Global health research partnerships with institutions from high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries are one of the European Commission'sflagship programmes. Here, we report on the ZikaPLAN research consortium fundedby the European Commission with the primary goal of addressing the urgentknowledge gaps related to the Zika epidemic and the secondary goal of building upresearch capacity and establishing a Latin American-European research network foremerging vector-borne diseases. Five years of collaborative research effort have led to a better understanding of the full clinical spectrum of congenital Zikasyndrome in children and the neurological complications of Zika virus infections in adults and helped explore the origins and trajectory of Zika virustransmission. Individual-level data from ZikaPLAN`s cohort studies were sharedfor joint analyses as part of the Zika Brazilian Cohorts Consortium, the EuropeanCommission-funded Zika Cohorts Vertical Transmission Study Group, and the WorldHealth Organization-led Zika Virus Individual Participant Data Consortium.Furthermore, the legacy of ZikaPLAN includes new tools for birth defectsurveillance and a Latin American birth defect surveillance network, an enhanced Guillain-Barre Syndrome research collaboration, a de-centralized evaluationplatform for diagnostic assays, a global vector control hub, and the REDe networkwith freely available training resources to enhance global research capacity invector-borne diseases.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), despite being discovered six decades earlier, became a majorhealth concern only after an epidemic in French Polynesia and an increase in the number of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Substantial evidence has been found tosupport the link between ZIKV and neurological complications in infants. Thevirus targets various cells in the brain, including radial glial cells, neuralprogenitor cells (NPCs), astrocytes, microglial and glioblastoma stem cells. Itaffects the brain cells by exploiting different mechanisms, mainly throughapoptosis and cell cycle dysregulation. The modulation of host immune responseand the inflammatory process has also been demonstrated to play a critical rolein ZIKV induced neurological complications. In addition to that, different ZIKVstrains have exhibited specific neurotropism and unique molecular mechanisms.This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of ZIKV-inducedneuroimmunopathogenesis by dissecting its main target cells in the brain, and theunderlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. We highlighted the roles of thedifferent ZIKV host factors and how they exploit specific host factors throughvarious mechanisms. Overall, it covers key components for understanding thecrosstalk between ZIKV and the brain.

LID - 10.1038/s41420-022-00958-x [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative diseasescharacterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) production and Phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau)protein in the cerebral cortex. The precise mechanisms of the cause, responsible for disease pathology and progression, are not well understood because there are multiple risk factors associated with the disease. Viral infection is one of the risk factors for AD, and we demonstrated that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection inbrain organoids could trigger AD pathological features, including Abeta and p-Tauexpression. AD-related phenotypes in brain organoids were upregulated viaendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) after ZIKV infection in brain organoids. Under persistent ER stress, activated-doublestranded RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER-resident (PERK) triggered thephosphorylation of Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) and then BACE, and GSK3alpha/beta related to AD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pharmacologicalinhibitors of PERK attenuated Abeta and p-Tau in brain organoids after ZIKVinfection.

AB  - During the Zika fever outbreak in Brazil in 2015-2016, only some babies frominfected mothers had teratogenic effects, suggesting that cofactors may influencecongenital transmission. We investigated the ZIKV infection profile in explantsand isolated cells from full-term human placenta to infection with the Brazilian Zika virus strain (ZIKV(BR)) and the effect of coinfection with the BrazilianHuman alphaherpesvirus 2 strain (HSV-2(BR)) on ZIKV replication. We found thatthe ZIKV(BR) infect the explants of amniotic and chorionic membranes, as well as chorionic villi core, but not the trophoblasts layer. It was also observed thatZIKV replication was higher in amniotic cells than chorionic and trophoblastscells. Upon coinfection, the replication of ZIKV(BR) was reduced according toexposed HSV-2(BR) load in trophoblasts cells and the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6cytokines were also reduced. These findings suggest that the placental cell typesand HSV-2(BR) coinfection may impact on ZIKV replication.

AB  - After decades of being considered non-pathogenic, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as animportant threat to human health during the epidemic of 2015-2016. ZIKVinfections are usually asymptomatic, but can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome inadults and microcephaly in newborns. As there are currently no approved antiviraldrugs against ZIKV, we tested anti-ZIKV activity of compounds from the NIHClinical Collection for which we previously showed antiviral activity against therelated dengue virus. One of the top hits from the screen was lacidipine, a1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that is approved as an antihypertensivedrug. Our data show that lacidipine is antiviral against ZIKV (strain H/PF/2013) in both Vero cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neural progenitor cells with IC50 values of 3.0 muM and <50 nM, respectively. Theantiviral effect was also observed against four other ZIKV strains from theAfrican and Asian lineages. Time-of-addition and replicon assays indicated thatlacidipine acts at the post-entry stage of the viral replication cycle,inhibiting viral genome replication. Lacidipine altered the subcellulardistribution of free cholesterol and neutral lipids, suggesting that theantiviral effect of lacidipine is mediated by altered trafficking of lipids.Together, these results identify lacidipine as a novel inhibitor of ZIKVreplication that likely disturbs trafficking of lipids needed for replicationorganelle formation.

AB  - The rapidly growing popularity of RNA structure probing methods is leading toincreasingly large amounts of available RNA structure information. This demandsthe development of efficient tools for the identification of RNAs sharing regionsof structural similarity by direct comparison of their reactivity profiles, henceenabling the discovery of conserved structural features. We here introduceSHAPEwarp, a largely sequence-agnostic SHAPE-guided algorithm for theidentification of structurally-similar regions in RNA molecules. Analysis ofDengue, Zika and coronavirus genomes recapitulates known regulatory RNAstructures and identifies novel highly-conserved structural elements. This workrepresents a preliminary step towards the model-free search and identification ofshared and conserved RNA structural features within transcriptomes.

AB  - The design of functional nano-objects by electrostatic self-assembly in solution signifies an emerging field with great potential. More specifically, the targetedcombination of electrostatic interaction with other effects and interactions,such as the positioning of charges on stiff building blocks, the use ofadditional amphiphilic, pi-pi stacking building blocks, or polyelectrolytes with certain architectures, have recently promulgated electrostatic self-assembly to aprinciple for versatile defined structure formation. A large variety ofarchitectures from spheres over rods and hollow spheres to networks in the sizerange of a few tenths to a few hundred nanometers can be formed. This reviewdiscusses the state-of-the-art of different approaches of nano-object formationby electrostatic self-assembly against the backdrop of corresponding solidmaterials and assemblies formed by other non-covalent interactions. In thisregard, particularly promising is the facile formation of triggerable structures,i.e. size and shape switching through light, as well as the use ofelectrostatically assembled nano-objects for improved photocatalysis and thepossible solar energy conversion in the future. Lately, this new field iseliciting an increasing amount of understanding; insights and limitations thereofare addressed in this article. Special emphasis is placed on the interconnection of molecular building block structures and the resulting nanoscale architecturevia the key of thermodynamics.

TI  - Portable sample processing for molecular assays: application to Zika virusdiagnostics.
PG  - 1748-1763
LID - 10.1039/d1lc01068a [doi]
AB  - This paper introduces a digital microfluidic (DMF) platform for portable,automated, and integrated Zika viral RNA extraction and amplification. Theplatform features reconfigurable DMF cartridges offering a closed, humidifiedenvironment for sample processing at elevated temperatures, as well asprogrammable control instrumentation with a novel thermal cycling unit regulated using a proportional integral derivative (PID) feedback loop. The system operateson 12 V DC power, which can be supplied by rechargeable battery packs for remote testing. The DMF system was optimized for an RNA processing pipeline consistingof the following steps: 1) magnetic-bead based RNA extraction from lysed plasmasamples, 2) RNA clean-up, and 3) integrated, isothermal amplification of ZikaRNA. The DMF pipeline was coupled to a paper-based, colorimetric cell-freeprotein expression assay for amplified Zika RNA mediated by toehold switch-based sensors. Blinded laboratory evaluation of Zika RNA spiked in human plasma yieldeda sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 75% respectively. The platform was thentransported to Recife, Brazil for evaluation with infectious Zika viruses, which were detected at the 100 PFU mL(-1) level from a 5 muL sample (equivalent to anRT-qPCR cycle threshold value of 32.0), demonstrating its potential as a sampleprocessing platform for miniaturized diagnostic testing.

TI  - Vaginal transmission causes prolonged Zika virus shedding in the vaginal mucosaand delays systemic dissemination.
PG  - 468-473
LID - 10.1111/imcb.12549 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a significant health threat worldwide. Although typically mosquito-borne, recent evidence suggests that ZIKV is also a sexuallytransmitted virus. While persistent ZIKV infections in male reproductive tissues have been identified, little is understood regarding the outcomes of primarysexual transmission in females. We investigated how the route of infectionaffects vaginal ZIKV shedding and dissemination. In two mouse models, vaginalinfection resulted in prolonged ZIKV shedding in the vaginal mucosa with delayed systemic infection. Furthermore, heightened vaginal inflammation did notinfluence ZIKV replication or dissemination, in contrast to previous studies ofmosquito-borne infection. Thus, vaginal infection significantly alters ZIKVinfection kinetics and must be considered when developing novel treatments.

TI  - Neurodevelopment in Children Exposed to Zika in utero: Clinical and MolecularAspects.
PG  - 758715
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.758715 [doi]
AB  - Five years after the identification of Zika virus as a human teratogen, wereviewed the early clinical manifestations, collectively called congenital Zikasyndrome (CZS). Children with CZS have a very poor prognosis with extremely lowperformance in motor, cognitive, and language development domains, andpractically all feature severe forms of cerebral palsy. However, thesemanifestations are the tip of the iceberg, with some children presenting milderforms of deficits. Additionally, neurodevelopment can be in the normal range inthe majority of the non-microcephalic children born without brain or eyeabnormalities. Vertical transmission and the resulting disruption in development of the brain are much less frequent when maternal infection occurs in the second half of the pregnancy. Experimental studies have alerted to the possibility ofother behavioral outcomes both in prenatally infected children and in postnataland adult infections.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that recently caused a series ofincreasingly severe outbreaks. We previously demonstrated that, compared with apre-epidemic isolate (ZIKV(CDN)), a Brazilian ZIKV isolate (ZIKV(BR)) possesses anovel capacity to suppress host immunity, resulting in delayed viral clearance.However, whether ZIKV(BR) modulates CD4 T cell responses remains unknown. In thisstudy, we show that, in comparison with ZIKV(CDN) infection, CD4 T cells are lesspolarized to the Th1 subtype following ZIKV(BR) challenge in mice. In contrast,we observed an enhanced accumulation of T follicular helper cells 10, 14, and 21 d postinfection with ZIKV(BR) This response correlated with an enhanced germinal center B cell response and robust production of higher avidity-neutralizing Absfollowing ZIKV(BR) infection. Taken together, our data suggest that contemporary ZIKV strains have evolved to differentially induce CD4 T cell, B cell, and Abresponses and this could provide a model to further define the signals requiredfor T follicular helper cell development.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), member of the family Flaviviridae belonging to genusFlavivirus, is an arthropod-borne virus. The ZIKV is known to cause severecongenital birth defects in neonates. Due to a large number of worldwideoutbreaks and associated neurological complications with ZIKV, a public healthemergency was declared by the World Health Organization on February 1, 2016. The virus exhibits neurotropism and has a specific propensity towards neuralprecursor cells of the developing brain. In utero ZIKV infection causes massivecell death in the developing brain resulting in various motor and cognitivedisabilities in newborns. The virus modulates cell machinery at several levels toreplicate itself and inhibits toll like receptors-3 signalling, deregulatesmicroRNA circuitry and induces a chronic inflammatory response in affected cells.Several significant advances have been made to understand the mechanisms ofneuropathogenesis, its prevention and treatment. The current review provides anupdate on cellular and molecular mechanisms of ZIKV-induced alterations in thefunction of various brain cells.

TI  - Mouse circulating extracellular vesicles contain virus-derived siRNAs active inantiviral immunity.
PG  - e109902
LID - 10.15252/embj.2021109902 [doi]
AB  - Induction and suppression of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) has been observed in mammals during infection with at least seven distinct RNA viruses, includingsome that are pathogenic in humans. However, while the cell-autonomous immuneresponse mediated by antiviral RNAi is gradually being recognized, little isknown about systemic antiviral RNAi in mammals. Furthermore, extracellularvesicles (EVs) also function in viral signal spreading and host immunity. Here,we show that upon antiviral RNAi activation, virus-derived small-interfering RNAs(vsiRNAs) from Nodamura virus (NoV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) enter the murine bloodstream via EVs for systemic circulation. vsiRNAs in the EVsare biologically active, since they confer RNA-RNA homology-dependent antiviralactivity in both cultured cells and infant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate thatvaccination with a live-attenuated virus, rendered deficient in RNAi suppression,induces production of stably maintained vsiRNAs and confers protective immunityagainst virus infection in mice. This suggests that vaccination withlive-attenuated VSR (viral suppressor of RNAi)-deficient mutant viruses could be a new strategy to induce immunity.

AB  - Flavivirus, such as Dengue Virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), infects millionsof people and cause the death of thousands of people every year. Despite manyefforts, there is no approved anti-flaviviral treatment available. In particular,some antiflavivirus compounds were investigated the cellular activities of DENVand ZIKV, but lacking the exploration of specific target enzyme, therebyresulting in the hindrance of structure-based drug design. One example isMontlukast, which was found to inhibit the replicon replication in DENV and ZIKV infected cells, with EC50 values as 1.03 muM (DENV) and 1.14 muM (ZIKV), whilethe underlying mechanism remains unclear. In our study, the inhibitory mechanismsof Montelukast against the replicon replication of DENV and ZIKV infected cellswere studied by using in silico approaches including inverse virtual screening(IVS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculation,and validated through in vitro protease assay, confirming Montelukast could bind to NS2B-NS3 proteases of DENV and ZIKV as a competitive inhibitor (IC50 for DENV:25.65 muM, for ZIKV: 15.57 muM). Moreover, Montelukast has no potentialoff-target effect on NS2B-NS3 protease from thrombin and trypsin inhibitoryassay. Overall, Montelukast may be used as a potential candidate to blockNS2B-NS3 protease as well as lead for structural modification.

TI  - Low Immune Cross-Reactivity between West Nile Virus and a Zika Virus VaccineBased on Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara.
LID - 354 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15030354 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus whose infection in pregnantwomen is associated with a spectrum of birth defects, which are together referredas Congenital Zika Syndrome. In addition, ZIKV can also induce Guillain-Barresyndrome, which is an autoimmune disease with neurological symptoms. The recentdescription of the first local infections of ZIKV in the European continenttogether with the expansion of one of its potential vectors, the Asian tigermosquito (Aedes albopictus), invite us to be prepared for future outbreaks ofZIKV in this geographical region. However, the antigenic similarities of ZIKVwith other flaviviruses can lead to an immune cross-reactivity with othercirculating flaviviruses inducing, in some cases, flavivirus-disease exacerbationby antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, which is a major concernfor ZIKV vaccine development. Until now, West Nile virus (WNV) is the mainmedically relevant flavivirus circulating in the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, anticipating the potential scenario of emergency vaccination against ZIKV inareas of Europe where WNV is endemic, in this investigation, we have evaluatedthe cross-reactivity between WNV and our previously developed ZIKV vaccinecandidate based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector expressing ZIKVstructural proteins (MVA-ZIKV). To this end, mice were first immunized withMVA-ZIKV, subsequently challenged with WNV, and then, the ZIKV- and WNV-specific immune responses and protection against WNV were evaluated. Our results indicate low cross-reactivity between the MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidate and WNV and absenceof ADE, supporting the safety of this ZIKV vaccine candidate in areas where thecirculation of WNV is endemic.

TI  - Human Brain Organoids as Models for Central Nervous System Viral Infection.
LID - 634 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030634 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenesis of viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) is poorlyunderstood, and this is partly due to the limitations of currently usedpreclinical models. Brain organoid models can overcome some of these limitations,as they are generated from human derived stem cells, differentiated in threedimensions (3D), and can mimic human neurodevelopmental characteristics.Therefore, brain organoids have been increasingly used as brain models inresearch on various viruses, such as Zika virus, severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Brainorganoids allow for the study of viral tropism, the effect of infection onorganoid function, size, and cytoarchitecture, as well as innate immune response;therefore, they provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of neurotropicviral infections and testing of antivirals in a physiological model. In thisreview, we summarize the results of studies on viral CNS infection in brainorganoids, and we demonstrate the broad application and benefits of using a human3D model in virology research. At the same time, we describe the limitations ofthe studies in brain organoids, such as the heterogeneity in organoid generation protocols and age at infection, which result in differences in results betweenstudies, as well as the lack of microglia and a blood brain barrier.

TI  - The Analogs of Furanyl Methylidene Rhodanine Exhibit Broad-Spectrum Inhibitoryand Inactivating Activities against Enveloped Viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 andIts Variants.
LID - 489 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030489 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, infectious diseases caused by viral infections have seriouslyendangered human health, especially COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, whichcontinues to spread worldwide. The development of broad-spectrum antiviralinhibitors is urgently needed. Here, we report a series of small-moleculecompounds that proved effective against human coronaviruses (HCoV), such asSARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern (VOCs), including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta(B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529), SARS-CoV,MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and other viruses with class I viral fusion proteins, suchas influenza virus, Ebola virus (EBOV), Nipah virus (NiV), and Lassa fever virus (LASV). They are also effective against class II enveloped viruses represented byZIKV and class III enveloped viruses represented by vesicular stomatitis virus(VSV). Further studies have shown that these compounds may exert antiviraleffects through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibiting the formation ofthe six-helix bundle, which is a typical feature of enveloped virus fusion withcell membranes, and/or targeting viral membrane to inactivate cell-free virions. These compounds are expected to become drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 andother enveloped viruses.

TI  - A Small-Plaque Isolate of the Zika Virus with Envelope Domain III MutationsAffect Viral Entry and Replication in Mammalian but Not Mosquito Cells.
LID - 480 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030480 [doi]
AB  - An Asian Zika virus (ZIKV) isolated from a Thai patient that was seriallypassaged in Primary Dog Kidney (PDK) cells for attenuation displayed both big andsmall plaque-forming viruses by the 7th passage. Two small-plaque isolates wereselected and purified for characterization as attenuated ZIKV candidates. Invitro growth kinetics showed significantly reduced titers for small-plaqueisolates in Vero cells early post-infection compared to the parental ZIKV and abig-plaque isolate, but no significant difference was observed in C6/36 cells.Viral entry experiments elucidate that titer reduction likely occurred due to thediminished entry capabilities of a small-plaque isolate. Additionally, asmall-plaque isolate displayed lowered neurovirulence in newborn mice compared to100% lethality from infection with the parental ZIKV. Genomic analysis revealedthe same three unique non-synonymous mutations for both small-plaque isolates:two on the envelope (E) protein at residues 310, alanine to glutamic acid(A310E), and 393, glutamic acid to lysine (E393K), and one on residue 355 of NS3,histidine to tyrosine (H355Y). Three-dimensional (3D) mapping suggests that the Eprotein mutations located on the receptor-binding and fusion domain III likelyaffect cell entry, tropism, and virulence. These ZIKV isolates and genotypicmarkers will be beneficial for vaccine development.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Zika Virus in Amphawa District, Thailand, after the 2016Pandemic.
LID - 476 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030476 [doi]
AB  - In 2016, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was declared a public health emergency ofinternational concern because of the neurological consequences in babies born to infected people. Because of the mild and nonspecific symptoms, serological tests are essential in epidemiological studies. However, cross-reactive antibodiesbetween other Flaviviridae members may complicate the interpretation of resultsof these tests. This study investigated the seroprevalence of ZIKV infection inSamut Songkhram in central Thailand which was affected by the Zika outbreak of2016. Three hundred and fifty volunteers aged 5-50 years in Amphawa District,Samut Songkhram, were enrolled between April 2017 and April 2018. ZIKVnonstructural protein 1 (NS1) immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to screen serum samples collected on the first day of enrollmentand after 6 and 12 months. The seroprevalence and seroconversion of ZIKV wereassessed. Cases of ZIKV seroconversion were verified as evidence of ZIKVinfection by NS1 blockade-of-binding ELISA and plaque reduction neutralizationtest (PRNT50). ZIKV seroprevalence in Amphawa was 15.1-17.8% with no significant change over the year. The total seroconversion rate throughout the year was 7/100person-years. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections was 4.5:1. The cases in our study confirmed the occurrence of occult ZIKV infections in thecommunity. These undetected infections might promote the spread of ZIKV invulnerable groups of the community.

TI  - Densovirus Oil Suspension Significantly Improves the Efficacy and Duration ofLarvicidal Activity against Aedes albopictus.
LID - 475 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030475 [doi]
AB  - Aedes albopictus is the sole vector for various mosquito-borne viruses, includingdengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Ecofriendly biological agents are required toreduce the spread of these mosquito-borne infections. Mosquito densoviruses(MDVs) are entomopathogenic mosquito-specific viruses, which can reduce thecapacity of isolated vectors and decrease mosquito-borne viral diseasetransmission. However, their variable pathogenicity restricts their commercialuse. In the present study, we developed a series of novel larvicide oilsuspensions (denoted Bacillus thuringiensis (Bti) oil, Ae. albopictus densovirus (AalDV-5) oil, and a mixture of AalDV-5+Bti oil), which were tested against Ae.albopictus larvae under experimental semi-field and open-field conditions. Theeffect of AalDV-5 on non-target species was also evaluated. The combined effectof AalDV-5+Bti was greater than that of individual toxins and was longer lasting and more persistent compared with the laboratory AalDV-5 virus strain. The virus was quantified on a weekly basis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)and was persistently detected in rearing water as well as in dead larvae.Wildtype densovirus is not pathogenic to non-target organisms. The presentfindings confirm the improved effect of a mixed microbial suspension (AalDV-5+Btioil) larvicide against Ae. albopictus. The development and testing of theseproducts will enable better control of the vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Human Polymorphonuclear Cells Support Zika Virus to Cross Endothelial Monolayerand Access Bloodstream.
LID - 321 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11030321 [doi]
AB  - The rapid spread of new outbreaks of human infection caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) has raised many global concerns since 2016. Despite the increasing knowledge ofthis virus, data on the pathogenesis of ZIKV are still missing. In particular, itis still unknown how the virus crosses the endothelial monolayer and gets access to the bloodstream. In the present work, we used human umbilical vein endothelialcells (HUVECs) as a model to study ZIKV infection in vitro. We demonstrated that HUVECs are an optimal reservoir for viral replication, as they were able tosustain ZIKV infection up to two weeks, without showing a cytopathic effect. Inorder to evaluate the integrity of endothelial monolayer, immunofluorescence was performed on mock-infected or ZIKV-infected cells +/- peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs) or polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), 48 h p.i., by usingan anti-VE-Cadherin antibody, a major adherence protein that maintains theintegrity of intercellular junctions. In addition to infection, we noted that thepresence of some components of the immune system, such as PMNs, played animportant role in altering the endothelial monolayer in cell junctions,suggesting that presence at the site of infection probably promotes the spread ofZIKV in vivo in the bloodstream.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens11030294 [doi]
AB  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated from a rhesus macaque in the Zika forestof Uganda in 1947. Isolated cases were reported until 2007, when the first major outbreaks of Zika infection were reported from the Island of Yap in Micronesiaand from French Polynesia in 2013. In 2015, ZIKV started to circulate in LatinAmerica, and in 2016, ZIKV was considered by WHO to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to cases of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), aZIKV-associated complication never observed before. After a peak of cases in2016, the infection incidence dropped dramatically but still causes concernbecause of the associated microcephaly cases, especially in regions where thedengue virus (DENV) is endemic and co-circulates with ZIKV. A vaccine could be animportant tool to mitigate CZS in endemic countries. However, the immunologicalrelationship between ZIKV and other flaviviruses, especially DENV, and the lownumbers of ZIKV infections are potential challenges for developing and testing a vaccine against ZIKV. Here, we discuss ZIKV vaccine development with theperspective of the immunological concerns implicated by DENV-ZIKVcross-reactivity and the use of a controlled human infection model (CHIM) as atool to accelerate vaccine development.

AB  - Flaviviruses cause a significant amount of mortality and morbidity, especially inregions where they are endemic. A recent example is the outbreak of Zika virusthroughout the world. Development of antiviral drugs against different viraltargets is as important as the development of vaccines. During viral replication,a single polyprotein precursor (PP) is produced and further cleaved intoindividual proteins by a viral NS2B-NS3 protease complex together with hostproteases. Flavivirus protease is one of the most attractive targets fordevelopment of therapeutic antivirals because it is essential for viral PPprocessing, leading to active viral proteins. In this review, we have summarized recent development in drug discovery targeting the NS2B-NS3 protease offlaviviruses, especially Zika, dengue, and West Nile viruses.

TI  - Stem cell-based region-specific brain organoids: Novel models to understandneurodevelopmental defects.
LID - 10.1002/bdr2.2004 [doi]
AB  - The study of human brain development and neurodevelopmental defects has remained challenging so far due to unique, specific, and complex underlying processes.Recent advances in the technologies and protocols of in vitro human brainorganoid development have led to immense possibilities of understanding theseprocesses. Human brain organoids are stem-cell derived three-dimensional in vitrotissues that resemble the developing fetal brain. Major advances in stem celltechniques pioneering the development of in vitro human brain development includereprogramming human somatic cells into induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) followedby the targeted differentiation of iPSCs into the cells of three embryonic germcell layers. The neural progenitor cells produced by the directed differentiationof iPSCs undergo some level of self-organization to generate in vitro human brainlike tissue. A three-dimensional differentiation approach applied to createregion-specific brain organoids has successfully led to develop highlyspecialized cortical, forebrain, pallium, and subpallium in vitro human brainorganoid models. These stem cell-based brain organoids are novel models to study human brain development, neurodevelopmental defects, chemical toxicity testing,and drug repurposing screening. This review focuses on the fundamentals of brain organoid development and applications. The novel applications of using corticalorganoids in understanding the mechanisms of Zika virus-induced microcephaly,congenital microcephaly, and lissencephaly are also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry (USZPIR) monitors infantsborn to mothers with confirmed or possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy.The surveillance case definition for Zika-associated birth defects includesmicrocephaly based on head circumference (HC). METHODS: We assessed birth andfollow-up data from infants with birth HC measurements <3rd percentile andbirthweight >/=10th percentile to determine possible misclassification ofmicrocephaly. We developed a schema informed by literature review and expertopinion to identify possible HC measurement inaccuracy using HC growth velocityand longitudinal HC measurements between 2 and 12 months of age. Two or more HCmeasurements were required for assessment. Inaccuracy in birth HC measurement wassuspected if growth velocity was >3 cm/month in the first 3 months or HC wasconsistently >25th percentile during follow-up. RESULTS: Of 6,799 liveborninfants in USZPIR, 351 (5.2%) had Zika-associated birth defects, of which 111 hadbirth HC measurements <3rd percentile and birthweight >/=10th percentile. Of84/111 infants with sufficient follow-up, 38/84 (45%) were classified as havingpossible inaccuracy of birth HC measurement, 19/84 (23%) had HC >/=3rd percentileon follow-up without meeting criteria for possible inaccuracy, and 27/84 (32%)had continued HC <3rd percentile. After excluding possible inaccuracies, theproportion of infants with Zika-associated birth defects including microcephalydecreased from 5.2% to 4.6%. CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of infants in USZPIRwith Zika-associated birth defects had only microcephaly, but indications ofpossible measurement inaccuracy were common. Implementation of this schema inlongitudinal studies can reduce misclassification of microcephaly.

LID - 10.1101/gr.275900.121 [doi]
AB  - RNA homodimerization is important for various physiological processes, including the assembly of membraneless organelles, RNA subcellular localization, andpackaging of viral genomes. However, understanding RNA dimerization has beenhampered by the lack of systematic in vivo detection methods. Here, we show that CLASH, PARIS, and other RNA proximity ligation methods detect RNA homodimerstranscriptome-wide as "overlapping" chimeric reads that contain more than onecopy of the same sequence. Analyzing published proximity ligation data sets, weshow that RNA:RNA homodimers mediated by direct base-pairing are rare across the human transcriptome, but highly enriched in specific transcripts, including U8snoRNA, U2 snRNA, and a subset of tRNAs. Mutations in the homodimerization domainof U8 snoRNA impede dimerization in vitro and disrupt zebrafish development invivo, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of this domain. Analysis ofvirus-infected cells reveals homodimerization of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika genomes,mediated by specific palindromic sequences located within protein-coding regions of N gene in SARS-CoV-2 and NS2A gene in Zika. We speculate that regions of viralgenomes involved in homodimerization may constitute effective targets forantiviral therapies.

PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05198-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) impose a major health andeconomic burden on human populations globally, with mosquitoes serving asimportant vectors. Measuring the ability of a mosquito population to transmit an arbovirus is important in terms of evaluating its public health risk. In thelaboratory, a variety of methods are used to estimate arboviral transmission bymosquitoes, including indirect methods involving viral detection from mosquitosaliva collected by forced salivation. The accuracy of indirect methods toestimate arbovirus transmission to live animal hosts has not been fullyevaluated. METHODS: We compared three commonly used proxies of arboviraltransmission, namely, the presence of virus in mosquito legs, in salivary glands (SG) and in saliva collected in capillary tubes using forced salivation, withdirect transmission estimates from mosquitoes to suckling mice. We analyzed five vector-virus combinations, including Aedes aegypti infected with chikungunyavirus, West Nile virus and Zika virus; Culex quinquefasciatus infected with West Nile virus; and Aedes triseriatus infected with La Crosse virus. RESULTS:Comparatively, the methods of detecting virus infection in mosquito legs and inSG were equally accurate in predicting transmission. Overall, the presence ofvirus in mosquito legs was a more accurate predictor of transmission than thecommonly implemented viral detection method using forced salivation into acapillary tube, and was subject to less technical variation. CONCLUSIONS: Theseresults suggest that, in general, forced salivation methods tend to underestimatevirus transmission, and they provide confidence in the use of mosquito legscreens to evaluate the transmission potential of a mosquito population.

LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10030641 [doi]
AB  - Genus Flavivirus contains several important human pathogens. Among these, theZika virus is an emerging etiological agent that merits concern. One of itsstructural proteins, prM, plays an essential role in viral maturation andassembly, making it an attractive drug and vaccine development target. Herein, wehave characterized ZikV-M as a potential viroporin candidate using threedifferent bacteria-based assays. These assays were subsequently employed toscreen a library of repurposed drugs from which ten compounds were identified as ZikV-M blockers. Mutational analyses of conserved amino acids in thetransmembrane domain of other flaviviruses, including West Nile and Dengue virus,were performed to study their role in ion channel activity. In conclusion, ourdata show that ZikV-M is a potential ion channel that can be used as a drugtarget for high throughput screening and drug repurposing.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes towards Zika virus: an Italian nation-widecross-sectional study.
PG  - 34-41
LID - 10.4415/ANN_22_01_05 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted throughinfected mosquitos. The aim of this Italian nation-wide study was to evaluategeneral population's knowledge and attitudes towards ZIKV, its transmission, and travel-related preventive measures. METHODS: This cross-sectional study wasconducted between July and August 2017, through a validated questionnaire.Predictors of knowledge were analysed through multivariate regression. RESULTS:Among 1119 respondents, 20% and 71% knew etiological agent and transmission routeof ZIKV infection, respectively. Approximately 43% ignored the preventivemeasures to be taken after returning from endemic areas. At multivariateanalysis, predictors of poor knowledge were age, living in Central or South Italyand Islands, being poorly educated, having never heard of or attended a travelclinic. CONCLUSIONS: This study captures an overall poor knowledge of Zika among general public. This research highlights the need of designing and implementingmeasures to improve travellers' awareness and protection against ZIKV.

TI  - Larvicidal Activity of Carbon Black against the Yellow Fever Mosquito Aedesaegypti.
LID - 307 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13030307 [doi]
AB  - The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is one of the deadliest animals on theplanet because it transmits several medically important arboviruses, includingZika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. Carbon-based nanoparticles (CNPs)derived from natural sources have previously been shown to have toxic effects on mosquito larvae and offer a potential alternative to chemical insecticides suchas pyrethroids, for which mosquitoes have evolved resistance. However, CNPsderived from industrial sources, such as carbon black, have not previously beenevaluated as larvicides. Here, we evaluate the effects of acommercially-available carbon black, EMPEROR((R)) 1800 (E1800), on mortality and development of pyrethroid-susceptible (PS) and pyrethroid-resistant (PR) strains of Ae. aegypti. We found that E1800 exhibited concentration-dependent mortalityagainst 1st instar larvae of both strains within the first 120 h after exposure, but after this period, surviving larvae did not show delays in their development to adults. Physical characterization of E1800 suspensions suggests that they formprimary particles of ~30 nm in diameter that fuse into fundamental aggregates of ~170 nm in diameter. Notably, larvae treated with E1800 showed internalaccumulation of E1800 in the gut and external accumulation on the respiratorysiphon, anal papillae, and setae, suggesting a physical mode of toxic action.Taken together, our results suggest that E1800 has potential use as a larvicidewith a novel mode of action for controlling PS and PR mosquitoes.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a serious public health problem since the firstmajor outbreak in 2007. Current ZIKV diagnostic methods can successfully identifyknown ZIKV but are impossible to track the origin of viruses and pathogens other than known ZIKV strains. We planned to determine the ability of Whole GenomeSequencing (WGS) in clinical epidemiology by evaluating whether it cansuccessfully detect the origin of ZIKV in a suspected case of laboratory-acquiredinfection (LAI). ZIKV found in the patient sample was sequenced with nanoporesequencing technology, followed by the production of the phylogenetic tree, basedon the alignment of 38 known ZIKV strains with the consensus sequence. Theclosest viral strain with the consensus sequence was the strain used in thelaboratory, with a percent identity of 99.27%. We think WGS showed itstime-effectiveness and ability to detect the difference between strains to thelevel of a single base. Additionally, to determine the global number of LAIs, aliterature review of articles published in the last 10 years was performed, and53 reports of 338 LAIs were found. The lack of a universal reporting system wasworrisome, as in the majority of cases (81.1%), the exposure route was unknown.

AB  - Arbovirus epidemiology lacks efficient and timely surveillance systems withaccurate outbreak alert signals. We devised a citywide integrated surveillancesystem combining entomologic, epidemiologic, and entomo-virologic data gatheredduring 2017-2020 in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil. We installed 3,476 adult mosquitotraps across the city and inspected traps every 2 months. We compared 5entomologic indices: traditional house and Breteau indices for larval surveys andtrap positivity, adult density, and mosquitoes per inhabitant indices for adulttrapping. We screened for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses in live adultAedes aegypti mosquitoes collected from traps. Indices based on adult mosquitosampling had higher outbreak predictive values than larval indices, and we wereable to build choropleth maps of infestation levels <36 h after each round oftrap inspection. Locating naturally infected vectors provides a timely supporttool for local public health managers to prioritize areas for interventionresponse to prevent virus outbreaks.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an RNA virus, rapidly spreads Aedes mosquito-borne sickness.Currently, there are neither effective vaccines nor therapeutics available toprevent or treat ZIKV infection. In this study, to address these unmet medicalneeds, we aimed to design B- and T-cell candidate multi-epitope-based subunitagainst ZIKV using an in silico approach. In this study we appliedimmunoinformatics, molecular docking, and dynamic simulation assessmentstargeting the most immunogenic proteins; the capsid (C), envelope (E) proteinsand the non-stuctural protein (NS1), described in our previous study, and whichpredicted immunodominant B and T cell epitopes. The final non-allergenic andhighly antigenic multi-epitope was constituted of immunogenic screened-epitopes(3 CTL and 3 HTL) and the beta-defensin as an adjuvant that have been linkedusing EAAAK, AAY, and GPGPG linkers, respectively. The final construct containing143 amino acids was characterized for its allergenicity, antigenicity, andphysiochemical properties; and found to be safe and immunogenic with a goodprediction of solubility. The existence of IFN-gamma epitopes asserts thecapacity to trigger strong immune responses. Subsequently, the molecular docking among vaccine and immune receptors (TLR2/TLR4) was revealed with a good bindingaffinity with and stable molecular interactions. Molecular dynamics simulationconfirmed the stability of the complexes. Finally, the construct was subjected toin silico cloning demonstrating the efficiently of its expression in E.coli.However, this study needs the experimental validation to demonstrate vaccinesafety and efficacy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - MiR-103a-3p Promotes Zika Virus Replication by Targeting OTU Deubiquitinase 4 to Activate p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 862580
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.862580 [doi]
AB  - Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in regulating virus infection and replication. However, the mechanism by which miRNA regulates Zika virus(ZIKV) replication remains elusive. We aim to explore how the differentiallyexpressed miR-103a-3p regulates ZIKV replication and to clarify the underlyingmolecular mechanism. Methods: Small RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed toidentify differentially expressed miRNAs in A549 cells with or without ZIKVinfection and some of the dysregulated miRNAs were validated by quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR). The effect of miR-103a-3p on ZIKV replication was examined bytransfecting miR-103a-3p mimic or negative control (NC) into A549 cells with orwithout p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 andexpression levels of ZIKV NS5 mRNA and NS1 protein were detected by qRT-PCR andWestern blot, respectively. The potential target genes for miR-103a-3p werepredicted by four algorithms and further validated by mutation analysis throughluciferase reporter assay. The predicated target gene OTU deubiquitinase (DUB) 4 (OTUD4) was over-expressed by plasmid transfection or silenced by siRNAtransfection into cells prior to ZIKV infection. Activation status of p38 MAPKsignaling pathway was revealed by looking at the phosphorylation levels of p38(p-p38) and HSP27 (p-HSP27) by Western blot. Results: Thirty-five differentially expressed miRNAs in ZIKV-infected A549 cells were identified by RNA-Seq analysis.Five upregulated and five downregulated miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR.One of the validated upregulated miRNAs, miR-103a-3p significantly stimulatedZIKV replication both at mRNA (NS5) and protein (NS1) levels. We found p38 MAPKsignaling was activated following ZIKV infection, as demonstrated by theincreased expression of the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and HSP27. Blocking p38MAPK signaling pathway using SB203580 inhibited ZIKV replication and attenuatedthe stimulating effect of miR-103a-3p on ZIKV replication. We further identified OTUD4 as a direct target gene of miR-103a-3p. MiR-103a-3p over-expression orOTUD4 silencing activated p38 MAPK signaling and enhanced ZIKV replication. Incontrast, OTUD4 over-expression inhibited p38 MAPK activation and decreased ZIKV replication. In addition, OTUD4 over-expression attenuated the stimulating effectof miR-103a-3p on ZIKV replication and activation of p38 MAPK signaling.Conclusion: Zika virus infection induced the expression of miR-103a-3p, whichsubsequently activated p38 MAPK signaling pathway by targeting OTUD4 tofacilitate ZIKV replication.

AB  - Innate immune responses induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).Viperin, a member of the radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) superfamily ofenzymes, is the product of one such ISG that restricts the replication of a broadspectrum of viruses. Here, we report a previously unknown antiviral mechanism in which viperin activates a ribosome collision-dependent pathway that inhibits bothcellular and viral RNA translation. We found that the radical SAM activity ofviperin is required for translation inhibition and that this is mediated byviperin's enzymatic product, 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP). Viperintriggers ribosome collisions and activates the MAPKKK ZAK pathway that in turnactivates the GCN2 arm of the integrated stress response pathway to inhibittranslation. The study illustrates the importance of translational repression in the antiviral response and identifies viperin as a translation regulator ininnate immunity.

AB  - Dengue is among the most rapidly spreading arboviral disease in the world. Alow-cost, easy to use point-of-care diagnostic tool for the detection anddifferentiation of dengue virus serotypes could improve clinical management,disease prevention, epidemiological surveillance, and outbreak monitoring,particularly in regions where multiple serotypes co-circulate. Despite widespreaddeployment, no commercial dengue antigen diagnostic test has proven effective in differentiating among dengue virus serotypes. In the current study, we firstestablished mAb pairs and developed a multiplex lateral flow immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of the dengue viral NS1 antigen and identification ofserotype. The proposed system, called Dengue serotype NS1 Multiplex LFIA,provides high sensitivity and specificity. In testing for JEV, ZIKV, YFV, WNV,and CHIKV, the multiplex LFIA gave no indication of cross- reactivity with cellculture supernatants of other flaviviruses or chikungunya virus. In analyzing 187samples from patients suspected of dengue infection, the detection sensitivityfor serotype D1 to D4 was 90.0%, 88.24%, 82.61%, and 83.33% and serotypespecificity was 98.74%, 96.13%, 99.39%, and 97.04%, respectively. Our multiplexLFIA can also identify mono- and co-infection of different serotype of dengueviruses in mosquitoes. The proposed Multiplex LFIA provides a simple tool for therapid detection of dengue serotypes and in the differential diagnosis of feverpatients in regions where medical resources are limited and/or multiple DENVsco-circulate.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to thegenus Flavivirus. Although ZIKV infection is usually known to exhibit mildclinical symptoms, intrauterine ZIKV infections have been associated with severe neurological manifestations, including microcephaly and Guillain Barre syndrome(GBS). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of ZIKV entryinto the central nervous system (CNS) and its effect on brain cells. Severalroutes of neuro-invasion have been identified, among which blood-brain barrier(BBB) disruption is the commonest mode of access. The molecular receptorsinvolved in viral entry remain unknown; with various proposed molecular ZIKV-hostinteractions including potential non-receptor mediated cellular entry. As ZIKVinvade neuronal cells, they trigger neurotoxic mechanisms via cell-autonomous andnon-cell autonomous pathways, resulting in neurogenesis dysfunction, viralreplication, and cell death, all of which eventually lead to microcephaly.Together, our understanding of the biological mechanisms of ZIKV exposure wouldaid in the development of anti-ZIKV therapies targeting host cellular and/orviral components to combat ZIKV infection and its neurological manifestations. Inthis present work, we review the current understanding of ZIKV entry mechanismsinto the CNS and its implications on the brain. We also highlight the status ofthe drug repurposing approach for the development of potential antiviral drugsagainst ZIKV.

PG  - 830205
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.830205 [doi]
AB  - Isoquercetin and quercetin are secondary metabolites found in a variety ofplants, including edible ones. Isoquercetin is a monoglycosylated derivative ofquercetin. When ingested, isoquercetin accumulates more than quercetin in theintestinal mucosa where it is converted to quercetin; the latter is absorbed intoenterocytes, transported to the liver, released in circulation, and distributedto tissues, mostly as metabolic conjugates. Physiologically, isoquercetin andquercetin exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, andanticoagulant activities. Generally isoquercetin is less active than quercetin invitro and ex vivo, whereas it is equally or more active in vivo, suggesting that it is primarily a more absorbable precursor to quercetin, providing morefavorable pharmacokinetics to the latter. Isoquercetin, like quercetin, has shownbroad-spectrum antiviral activities, significantly reducing cell infection byinfluenza, Zika, Ebola, dengue viruses among others. This ability, together with their other physiological properties and their safety profile, has led to theproposition that administration of these flavonols could prevent infection bysevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), or arrest theprogression to severity and lethality of resulting coronavirus disease of 2019(Covid-19). In silico screening of small molecules for binding affinity toproteins involved SARS-CoV-2 life cycle has repeatedly situated quercetin andisoquercetin near to top of the list of likely effectors. If experiments in cellsand animals confirm these predictions, this will provide additionaljustifications for the conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the prophylacticand therapeutic efficacy of these flavonols in Covid-19.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and outbreaks of ZIKV have been reported in Africa, Americas and other parts of the world lately. The ZIKVepidemic has received extensive attention due to its ability to cause seriousmedical consequences and complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barresyndrome in recent years. Up to now, there are no specific treatments or vaccinesavailable for ZIKV infection, which highlights the urgent need for developing newtherapies. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of novel6-methyl-7-acetylenenyl-7-deazapurine nucleoside analogs as potential inhibitors of ZIKV replication. The biological activities against ZIKV replication wereevaluated and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) was also studied. Amongthe compounds evaluated, nucleoside analog 38 (EC50 = 2.8 +/- 0.8 muM, EC90 = 6.8+/- 2.3 muM) showed the most potent anti-ZIKV activity with low cytotoxicity(CC50 = 54.1 +/- 6.9 muM) in an A549 based cellular model. The inhibitoryactivity of 38 was about 5 times more potent than the positive control NITD008.Notably, 38 showed similar inhibition potency against different ZIKV strains(ZG-01 and MR766) in a variety of host cell types including SNB19, A549, Huh7,Vero. In addition, 38 (Kd = 1.87 muM) has a stronger affinity to ZIKVRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein than NITD008 (Kd = 3.43 muM) in thenon-phosphorylation assay. These results indicated that compound 38 may serve as a promising candidate in future anti-ZIKV drug discovery.

AB  - Zika virus infection can result in devastating pregnancy outcomes when it crossesthe placental barrier. For human pregnancies, the mechanisms of verticaltransmission remain enigmatic. Utilizing a human placenta-cotyledon perfusionmodel, we examined Zika virus exposure in the absence of maternal factors. Todistinguish responses related to viral infection vs. recognition, we evaluatedcotyledons perfused with either active or inactivated Zika virus. Active Zikavirus exposure resulted in infection, cell death and syncytium injury. Pathology corresponded with transcriptional changes related to inflammation and innateimmunity. Inactive Zika virus exposure also led to syncytium injury and relatedchanges in gene expression but not cell death. Our observations revealpathologies and innate immune responses that are dependent on infection or virus placenta interactions independent of productive infection. Importantly, ourfindings indicate that Zika virus can infect and compromise placentas in theabsence of maternal humoral factors that may be protective.

AB  - Aedes aegypti [Linnaeus in Hasselquist; yellow fever mosquito] transmits several viruses that infect millions of people each year, including Zika, dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and West Nile. Pathogen transmission occurs during bloodfeeding. Only the females blood feed as they require a bloodmeal for oogenesis;in the bloodmeal, holo-transferrin and hemoglobin provide the females with a highiron load. We are interested in the effects of the bloodmeal on the expression ofiron-associated proteins in oogenesis. Previous data showed that followingdigestion of a bloodmeal, ovarian iron concentrations doubles by 72 hr. We haveused shotgun proteomics to identify proteins expressed in Ae. aegypti ovaries at two oogenesis developmental stages following blood feeding, and tandem masstag-labeling proteomics to quantify proteins expressed at one stage followingfeeding of a controlled iron diet. Our findings provide the first report ofmosquito ovarian protein expression in early and late oogenesis. We identifyproteins differentially expressed in the two oogenesis development stages. Weestablish that metal-associated proteins play an important role in Ae. aegyptioogenesis and we identify new candidate proteins that might be involved inmosquito iron metabolism. Finally, this work identified a unique second ferritin light chain subunit, the first reported in any species. The shotgun proteomicdata are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005893, while thetandem mass tag-labeled proteomic data are available with identifier PXD028242.

AB  - Oropouche virus (OROV) is an arthropod-borne orthobunyavirus found in SouthAmerica and causes Oropouche fever, a febrile infection similar to dengue. It is the second most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in South America afterdengue. Over 500,000 cases have been diagnosed since the virus was firstdiscovered in 1955; however, this is likely a significant underestimate given thelimited availability of diagnostics. No fatalities have been reported to date,however, up to 60% of cases have a recurrent phase of disease within one month ofrecovery from the primary disease course. The main arthropod vector is the bitingmidge Culicoides paraensis, which has a geographic range as far north as theUnited States and demonstrates the potential for OROV to geographically expand.The transmission cycle is incompletely understood and vertebrate hosts includeboth non-human primates and birds further supporting the potential ability of thevirus to spread. A number of candidate antivirals have been evaluated againstOROV in vitro but none showed antiviral activity. Surprisingly, there is only onereport in the literature on candidate vaccines. We suggest that OROV is anundervalued pathogen much like chikungunya, Schmallenberg, and Zika viruses were before they emerged. Overall, OROV is an important emerging disease that has beenunder-investigated and has the potential to cause large epidemics in the future. Further research, in particular candidate vaccines, is needed for this important pathogen.

TI  - Could species-focused suppression of Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito,and Aedes albopictus, the tiger mosquito, affect interacting predators? Anevidence synthesis from the literature.
PG  - 2729-2745
LID - 10.1002/ps.6870 [doi]
AB  - The risks of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus nuisance and vector-bornediseases are rising and the adverse effects of broad-spectrum insecticideapplication have promoted species-specific techniques, such as sterile insecttechnique (SIT) and other genetic strategies, as contenders in their controloperations. When specific vector suppression is proposed, potential effects onpredators and wider ecosystem are some of the first stakeholder questions. These are not the only Aedes vectors of human diseases, but are those for which SIT andgenetic strategies are of most interest. They vary ecologically and in habitatorigin, but both have behaviorally human-adapted forms with expanding ranges. Theaquatic life stages are where predation is strongest due to greater resourcepredictability and limited escape opportunity. These vectors' anthropic formsusually use ephemeral water bodies and man-made containers as larval habitats;predators that occur in these are mobile, opportunistic and generalist. Noliterature indicates that any predator depends on larvae of either species. Asadults, foraging theory predicts these mosquitoes are of low profitability topredators. Energy expended hunting and consuming will mostly outweigh theirenergetic benefit. Moreover, as adult biomass is mobile and largelydisaggregated, any predator is likely to be a generalist and opportunist. Thiswork, which summarizes much of the literature currently available on thepredators of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, indicates it is highly unlikely thatany predator species depends on them. Species-specific vector control to reducenuisance and disease is thus likely to be of negligible or limited impact onnontarget predators. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Replication is the key barrier during the dual-host adaptation of mosquito-borne flaviviruses.
PG  - e2110491119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2110491119 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFs) adapt to a dual-host transmission circlebetween mosquitoes and vertebrates. Dual-host affiliated insect-specificflaviviruses (dISFs), discovered from mosquitoes, are phylogenetically similar toMBFs but do not infect vertebrates. Thus, dISF-MBF chimeras could be an idealmodel to study the dual-host adaptation of MBFs. Using the pseudoinfectiousreporter virus particle and reverse genetics systems, we found dISFs enteredvertebrate cells as efficiently as the MBFs but failed to initiate replication.Exchange of the untranslational regions (UTRs) of Donggang virus (DONV), a dISF, with those from Zika virus (ZIKV) rescued DONV replication in vertebrate cells,and critical secondary RNA structures were further mapped. Essential UTR-binding host factors were screened for ZIKV replication in vertebrate cells, displayingdifferent binding patterns. Therefore, our data demonstrate a post-entrycross-species transmission mechanism of MBFs, while UTR-host interaction iscritical for dual-host adaptation.

AB  - In 2015 the correlation between increasing numbers of cases of microcephaly and azika virus outbreak led to recognition of an epidemic of congenital zika virussyndrome (CZVS), highlighting well-known weaknesses in health care measures. Thisarticle examines the network of virtual information available on health serviceprovision for children suffering from CZVS in Rio de Janeiro. Using social media analysis, data on information about services and care institutions were collectedfrom virtual sources using the Google search engine, so as to assess relationsamong these actors in 2018. The results revealed a fragmented network centred on virtual sources and secondary and tertiary public care services, with strikingproximity of press sources to public services. Also salient was the isolation of private services and the lack of dialogue between philanthropic and publicservices. Moreover, the information offered was found to be insufficient andsuperficial, despite the gaps in the formal rehabilitation network. The evidence thus suggested the importance of a well-established health care service networkand the necessity of fostering communication through virtual media.

AB  - The Zika epidemic brought to the fore the birth of children with unknown andunexpected needs that demand longitudinal follow-up, strengthening the bond,comprehensiveness and coordination of care in health, which are essentialattributes of primary health care (PHC). This article aims to evaluate theorientation of PHC care, using the PCATool-Brasil. The data were collectedbetween 2016 and 2019, by means of interviews with parents of children who wereborn in a public maternity hospital in Recife (state of Pernambuco) betweenOctober 2015 and February 2016, a critical period of the microcephaly outbreak,especially in the Northeast of Brazil. The parents of 109 children participatedin the survey, 15.6% of which had a confirmed microcephaly diagnosis. The degree of affiliation and access was sufficient, but the aspects of coordination ofcare, longitudinality, comprehensiveness, family and community orientation wereinsufficient. In the context of congenital Zika syndrome, these attributes areessential for the care of children and families. The fostering of health fromthese domains depends on the orientation of the models of care and theirmanagement with state and federal investments. The defense of life depends on theability to place life above all other rationalities.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0264300 [doi]
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive mosquito species that is considered a potential vector of about 22 arboviruses, among which dengue,chikungunya and Zika. Here we report the first record of Aedes albopictus in the territory of the Republic of Kosovo. The first finding, in July 2020, was driven by a photo of an adult mosquito published by a citizen in social media. Thesubsequent field investigation in July 2020 confirmed the presence of adultmosquitoes by human landing catch and collection of eggs in ovitraps at thevillage Zhur. Monitoring was performed for 7 weeks with ovitraps and BG-Sentinel adult traps at 36 sampling stations from 7 localities, in the Southern part ofKosovo, on the border with Albania. Fifty-two out of 81 ovitrap samples resulted positive for the presence of Ae. albopictus. A total of 2,711 eggs are collected in 22 out 36 stations and a total of 78 adults from 4 out 4 stations with BGSentinel trap and 15 adults with handled electric aspirator. Our finding showsthat the tiger mosquito is expanding its geographical range in the Balkans,southeastern Europe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital disorders associated with prenatal vertical transmissionof Zika virus (ZIKV) is well established since the 2016 outbreak in the Americas.However, despite clinical reports of similar mode of transmission for otherflaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), the phenomenon has not beenexperimentally explored. METHODS: Pregnant AG129 mice were infected with DENV1 inthe presence or absence of enhancing antibodies at different gestational timepoints. ZIKV was used for comparison. We quantified viral load in fetus andplacentas and performed comprehensive gene expression profiling in the maternal(decidua) and fetal portion of placenta separately. FINDINGS: We demonstrate in alaboratory experimental setting that DENV can be transmitted vertically in agestation stage-dependent manner similar to ZIKV, and this incidence drastically increases in the presence of enhancing antibodies. Interestingly, a high rate of DENV fetal infection occurs even though the placental viral load is significantlylower than that found in ZIKV-infected dams. Comprehensive gene expressionprofiling revealed DENV infection modulates a variety of inflammation-associated genes comparable to ZIKV in decidua and fetal placenta in early pregnancy.INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the virus-induced modulation of hostgene expression may facilitate DENV to cross the placental barrier in spite oflower viral burden compared to ZIKV. This mouse model may serve to identify thehost determinants required for the vertical transmission of flaviviruses anddevelop appropriate countermeasures.

AB  - The use of serological tests is valuable to diagnose Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and carry out epidemiological surveillance. However, ZIKV serological tests mayresult in false positives due to cross-reactivity between antibodies againstother Flavivirus, especially dengue virus that worldwide disseminated. We usedthree online tools to predict amino acid sequences of B-cell epitopes. Weselected and synthetized two epitopes that showed appropriate features in themolecular dynamic simulation and demonstrated to be suitable for serologicalassays.

TI  - Tracking the Replication-Competent Zika Virus with Tetracysteine-Tagged CapsidProtein in Living Cells.
PG  - e0184621
LID - 10.1128/jvi.01846-21 [doi]
AB  - Real-time imaging of viruses in living cells considerably facilitates the studyof virus-host interactions. However, generating a fluorescently labeledrecombinant virus is challenging, especially for Zika virus (ZIKV), which causes microcephaly in neonates. The monocistronic nature of the ZIKV genome represents a major challenge for generating a replication-competent genetically engineeredZIKV suitable for real-time imaging. Here, we generated a fluorescent ZIKV byintroducing the biarsenical tetracysteine (TC) tag system. After separatelyinserting the TC tag at six sites in the capsid protein, we found that only when we inserted the TC tag at the site of amino acids 27/28 (AA27/28, or TC27) could the genetically engineered ZIKV be rescued. Importantly, the TC27 ZIKV ischaracterized as replication and infection competent. After labeling the TC tagwith the fluorescent biarsenical reagents, we visualized the dynamic nuclearimport behavior of the capsid protein. In addition, using the single-particletracking technology, we acquired real-time imaging evidence that ZIKV moved alongthe cellular filopodia and entered into the cytoplasm via endocytosis. Thus, weprovide a feasible strategy to generate a replication-competent TC-tagged ZIKVfor real-time imaging, which should greatly facilitate the study of ZIKV-hostinteractions in living cells. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is the mosquito-borne enveloped flavivirus that causes microcephaly in neonates. While real-timeimaging plays a critical role in dissecting viral biology, no fluorescent,genetically engineered ZIKV for single-particle tracking is currently available. Here, we generated a replication-competent genetically engineered ZIKV byintroducing the tetracysteine (TC) tag into its capsid protein. After labelingthe TC tag with the fluorescent biarsenical reagents, we visualized the nuclearimport behavior of the capsid protein and the endocytosis process of single ZIKV particle. Taken together, these results demonstrate a fluorescent labelingstrategy to track the ZIKV-host interactions at both the protein level and theviral particle level. Our replication-competent TC27 ZIKV should open an avenueto study the ZIKV-host interactions and may provide applications for antiviralscreening.

TI  - Reprogramming of red blood cell metabolism in Zika virus-infected donors.
PG  - 1045-1064
LID - 10.1111/trf.16851 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses remain a burden to global health; in particular, Zika virus (ZIKV) has been reported in 87 countries andterritories. In healthy blood donors, ZIKV RNA can be detected in red blood cells(RBCs) months after infection, clearance of detectable nucleic acid in plasma,and seroconversion. However, little information is available on the impact ofZIKV infection to metabolism. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We applied massspectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics approaches to investigate theimpact of ZIKV infection on RBCs over the course of infection. ZIKV-infectedblood donors (n = 25) were identified through molecular and serologic methods,which included nucleic acid amplification testing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of ZIKV RNA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) for detection of flavivirus-specific IgM and IgG. RESULTS: In ZIKVRNA-positive donors, we observed lower glucose and lactate levels, and higherlevels of ribose phosphate, suggestive of the activation of the pentose phosphatepathway. The top pathways altered in RBCs from ZIKV-IgM-positive donors includeamino acid metabolism and biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis,linoleic acid and arachidonate metabolism and glutathione metabolism. RBCs fromZIKV-infected donors had increased levels of early glycolytic metabolites, andhigher levels of metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway. Alterations inacyl-carnitine and fatty acid metabolism are consistent with impaired membranelipid homeostasis in RBCs from ZIKV IgM positive donors. CONCLUSION: RBC fromhealthy blood donors who had been infected by ZIKV are characterized bylong-lasting metabolic alterations even months after infection has resolved.

TI  - Anti-Zika Virus Activity of Plant Extracts Containing Polyphenols and Triterpeneson Vero CCL-81 and Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells.
PG  - e202100842

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a global threat associated to neurologicaldisorders in adults and microcephaly in children born to infected mothers. Novaccine or drug is available against ZIKV. We herein report the anti-ZIKVactivity of 36 plant extracts containing polyphenols and/or triterpenes.ZIKV-infected Vero CCL-81 cells were treated with samples at non-cytotoxicconcentrations, determined by MTT and LDH assays. One third of the extractselicited concentration-dependent anti-ZIKV effect, with viral loads reductionfrom 0.4 to 3.8 log units. The 12 active extracts were tested on ZIKV-infectedSH-SY5Y cells and significant reductions of viral loads (in log units) wereinduced by Maytenus ilicifolia (4.5 log), Terminalia phaeocarpa (3.7 log),Maytenus rigida (1.7 log) and Echinodorus grandiflorus (1.7 log) extracts. Mediancytotoxic concentration (CC50 ) of these extracts in Vero cells were higher than in SH-SY5Y lineage. M. ilicifolia (IC50 =16.8+/-10.3 mug/mL, SI=3.4) and T.phaeocarpa (IC50 =22.0+/-6.8 mug/mL, SI=4.8) were the most active extracts.UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of M. ilicifolia extract led to the identification of 7triterpenes, of which lupeol and a mixture of friedelin/friedelinol showed noactivity against ZIKV. The composition of T. phaeocarpa extract comprisesphenolic acids, ellagitannins and flavonoids, as recently reported by us. Inconclusion, the anti-ZIKV activity of 12 plant extracts is here described for thefirst time and polyphenols and triterpenes were identified as the probablebioactive constituents of T. phaeocarpa and M. ilicifolia, respectively.

AB  - Problems with vector surveillance are a major barrier for the effective controlof vector-borne disease transmission through Latin America. Here, we presentresults from a 80-week longitudinal study where Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera:Culicidae) ovitraps were monitored weekly at 92 locations in Puntarenas, acoastal city in Costa Rica with syndemic Zika, chikungunya and denguetransmission. We used separate models to investigate the association of eitherAe. aegypti-borne arboviral cases or Ae. aegypti egg counts with remotely sensed environmental variables. We also evaluated whether Ae. aegypti-borne arboviralcases were associated with Ae. aegypti egg counts. Using cross-correlation andtime series modeling, we found that arboviral cases were not significantlyassociated with Ae. aegypti egg counts. Through model selection we found thatcases had a non-linear response to multi-scale (1-km and 30-m resolution)measurements of temperature standard deviation (SD) with a lag of up to 4 weeks, while simultaneously increasing with finely-grained NDVI (30-m resolution).Meanwhile, median ovitrap Ae. aegypti egg counts increased, and respectivelydecreased, with temperature SD (1-km resolution) and EVI (30-m resolution) with alag of 6 weeks. A synchrony analysis showed that egg counts had a travelling wavepattern, with synchrony showing cyclic changes with distance, a pattern notobserved in remotely sensed data with 30-m and 10-m resolution. Spatially, using generalized additive models, we found that eggs were more abundant at locationswith higher temperatures and where EVI was leptokurtic during the study period.Our results suggest that, in Puntarenas, remotely sensed environmental variables are associated with both Ae. aegypti-borne arbovirus transmission and Ae. aegyptiegg counts from ovitraps.

AB  - Introduction. Landscape changes disrupt environmental, social and biologicalsystems, altering pathogen spillover and transmission risks. This study aims toquantify the impact of specific land management practices on spillover andtransmission rates of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases within Malaysian Borneo.This protocol describes a cohort study with integrated ecological sampling toassess how deforestation and agricultural practices impact pathogen flow fromwildlife and vector populations to human infection and detection by healthfacilities. This will focus on malaria, dengue and emerging arboviruses(Chikungunya and Zika), vector-borne diseases with varying contributions ofsimian reservoirs within this setting. Methods. A prospective longitudinalobservational cohort study will be established in communities residing or workingwithin the vicinity of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project,a landscape gradient within Malaysian Borneo encompassing different plantationand forest types. The primary outcome of this study will be transmissionintensity of selected zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, as quantified bychanges in pathogen-specific antibody levels. Exposure will be measured usingpaired population-based serological surveys conducted at the beginning and end ofthe two-year cohort study. Secondary outcomes will include the distribution andinfection rates of Aedes and Anopheles mosquito vectors, human risk behavioursand clinical cases reported to health facilities. Longitudinal data on humanbehaviour, contact with wildlife and GPS tracking of mobility patterns will becollected throughout the study period. This will be integrated with entomologicalsurveillance to monitor densities and pathogen infection rates of Aedes andAnopheles mosquitoes relative to land cover. Within surrounding health clinics,continuous health facility surveillance will be used to monitor reportedinfections and febrile illnesses. Models will be developed to assess spilloverand transmission rates relative to specific land management practices andevaluate abilities of surveillance systems to capture these risks.

AB  - In the past years, numerous new fatal infections have emerged, including Ebola,Nipah, and Zika viruses, as well as coronaviruses. Recently, infections withsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged inChina, and were then transmitted all over the world, causing the coronavirusdisease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is transmitted at a higher rate than other diseases caused by coronaviruses. At the time of writing this review, COVID-19 isnot contained in most countries in spite of quarantine, physical distancing, and enhanced hygiene measures. In this review, I address different methods forpassive and active immunization against this virus, which is known to cause fatalrespiratory disease, including natural passive immunization by breast milk,natural active immunization by herd immunization, artificial passive immunizationby convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies, and artificial activeimmunization by vaccination. I hope this review will help design a prophylacticapproach against outbreaks and pandemics of related coronaviruses in the future.

AB  - In 2015, Brazil reported an outbreak identified as Zika virus (ZIKV) infectionassociated with congenital abnormalities. To date, a total of 86 countries andterritories have described evidence of Zika infection and recently the appearanceof the African ZIKV lineage in Brazil highlights the risk of a new epidemic. The spectrum of ZIKV infection-induced alterations at both cellular and molecularlevels is not completely elucidated. Here, we present for the first time the geneexpression responses associated with prenatal ZIKV infection from ocular cells.We applied a recently developed non-invasive method (impression cytology) whichuse eye cells as a model for ZIKV studies. The ocular profiling revealedsignificant differences between exposed and control groups, as well as adifferent pattern in ocular transcripts from Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS)compared to ZIKV-exposed but asymptomatic infants. Our data showed pathwaysrelated to mismatch repair, cancer, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and genesprobably causative or protective in the modulation of ZIKV infection. Ocularcells revealed the effects of ZIKV infection on primordial neuronal cell genes,evidenced by changes in genes associated with embryonic cells. The changes ingene expression support an association with the gestational period of theinfection and provide evidence for the resulting clinical and ophthalmologicalpathologies. Additionally, the findings of cell death- and cancer-associatedderegulated genes raise concerns about the early onset of other potentialpathologies including the need for tumor surveillance. Our results thus providedirect evidence that infants exposed prenatally to the Zika virus, not only with CZS but also without clinical signs (asymptomatic) express cellular and molecularchanges with potential clinical implications.

PG  - e051216
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051216 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) of young peoplecontinue to present a high burden and remain underinvested. This is more so inlow and middle-income countries (LMICs), where empirical evidence revealsdisruption of SRHR maintenance, need for enhancement of programmes, resources andservices during pandemics. Despite the importance of the subject, there is nopublished review yet combining recent disease outbreaks such as (H1N1/09, Zika,Ebola and SARS-COV-2) to assess their impact on adolescents and youth SRHR inLMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will adopt a four-step search to reach themaximum possible number of studies. In the first step, we will carry out alimitedpreliminary search in databases for getting relevant keywords (appendix1). Second, we will search in four databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embaseand PsycINFO. The search would begin from the inception of the first majoroutbreak in 2009 (H1N1/09) up to the date of publication of the protocol in early2022. We will search databases using related keywords, screen title & abstractand review full texts of the selected titles to arrive at the list of eligiblestudies. In the third stage, we will check their eligibility to the includedarticle's reference list. In the fourth stage, we will check the citations ofincluded papers in phase 2 to complete our study selection. We will include alltypes of original studies and without any language restriction in our finalsynthesis. Our review results will be charted for each pandemic separately andinclude details pertaining to authors, year, country, region of the study, study design, participants (disaggregated by age and gender), purpose and reportassociated SRHR outcomes. The review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Itemsfor Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guideline (PRISMA-ScR). PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: Patients or public were notinvolved in this study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical assessment is notrequired for this study. The results of the study will be presented inpeer-reviewed publications and conferences on adolescent SRHR.

AB  - Insecticide use is the primary method of attempting to reduce or control thespread of mosquito-borne diseases. Insecticide resistance is a major concern asresistance will limit the efficacy of vector-control efforts. The lower RioGrande Valley region of South Texas has had autochthonous transmission ofmultiple mosquito-borne diseases including those caused by dengue virus,chikungunya virus, and Zika virus. However, the current status of mosquitoresistance to commonly used pesticides in this region is unknown. In this study, we collected field samples from multiple municipalities in South Texas andassessed resistance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottlebioassay. All populations exhibited characteristics of resistance, and permethrinwas the most effective insecticide with an average mortality rate of 44.78%.Deltamethrin and sumethrin had significantly lower mortality rates of 20.31% and 32.16%, respectively, although neither of these insecticides are commonly usedfor vector-control activities in this region. Depending on which insecticide was used, there was little significance between each of the 7 cities. Seasonalvariation in resistance was observed among the collection sites. Bothdeltamethrin and sumethrin exhibited an increase in susceptibility over thecourse of 10 months, while permethrin exhibited a decrease in susceptibility.These data highlight the need for further studies to determine if variations inresistance observed are repeated. The data and future findings may be useful indetermining the most effective strategies for pesticide use and rotation.

AB  - In this paper we tested how oxysterols influence on fusion process between viral lipid envelope and host cells membranes. For this purpose, the Zika virus wasselected, while dendritic cell (DC) and neural cell (NC) membranes were chosen astarget membranes. The investigated systems were modeled as multicomponentLangmuir monolayers and characterized using surface manometry and imaging inmicro- (Brewster angle microscopy, BAM) and nanoscale (Atomic Force Microscopy,AFM) to monitor local heterogeneity. The fusion process was conducted by mixingviral and host cell membranes devoid and in the presence of oxysterols:25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) and 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (7beta-OH) asrepresentatives of chain- and ring-oxidized oxysterols, respectively. Our resultsshow that oxysterols hinder the fusion with host cell membranes by modifyingtheir biophysical properties. Moreover, oxysterols applied to an already infectedmembrane reverse the changes caused by the infection. It could therefore beconcluded that oxysterols may display antiviral activity in two ways: theyprevent the healthy membrane from viral infection by blocking the fusion process;and protect already infected membrane from pathological changes induced by thevirus.

LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7110a3 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of dengue disease, caused by the dengue virus (DENV) (aflavivirus), often requires serologic testing during acute and early convalescentphases of the disease. Some symptoms of DENV infection, such as nonspecificfever, are similar to those caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus thatcauses COVID-19. In studies with few COVID-19 cases, positive DENV immunoglobulinM (IgM) results were reported with various serologic tests, indicating possiblecross-reactivity in these tests for DENV and SARS-CoV-2 infections (1,2). DENVantibodies can cross-react with other flaviviruses, including Zika virus. Toassess the potential cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2, DENV, and Zika virus IgMantibodies, serum specimens from 97 patients from Puerto Rico and 12 U.S.-basedpatients with confirmed COVID-19 were tested using the DENV Detect IgM Captureenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (InBios International).* In addition,122 serum specimens from patients with confirmed dengue and 121 from patientswith confirmed Zika virus disease (all from Puerto Rico) were tested using theSARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig Spike Protein ELISA (CDC).(dagger) Results obtained for DENV,Zika virus IgM, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicated 98% test specificity andminimal levels of cross-reactivity between the two flaviviruses and SARS-CoV-2.These findings indicate that diagnoses of dengue or Zika virus diseases with the serological assays described in this report are not affected by COVID-19, nor do dengue or Zika virus diseases interfere with the diagnosis of COVID-19.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19052860 [doi]
AB  - Residents of informal settlements, the world over, suffer consequences due to thelack of drainage and greywater management, impacting human and environmentalhealth. In Brazil, the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in urban areaspromotes infections of the Zika virus as well as companion viruses, such asdengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. By using observation and interviews withthe community, this paper shows how a simple sustainable drainage system approachcould prevent the accumulation of on-street standing water, and thus reduceopportunities for the mosquito to breed and reduce infection rates. During theinterview phase, it became apparent that underlying misinformation andmisunderstandings prevail related to existing environmental conditions in favelasand the role of the mosquito in infecting residents. This inhibitsrecommendations made by professionals to reduce breeding opportunities for thedisease vector. Whilst unrest is an issue in favelas, it is not the only issuepreventing the human right to reliable, safe sanitation, including drainage. In"pacified" favelas which may be considered safe(r), the infrastructure is stillpoor and is not connected to the city-wide sanitation/treatment networks.

AB  - This article describes the Salvador Primary Care Longitudinal Study of ChildDevelopment (CohortDICa). The exposed group was defined by confirmation ofCongenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) diagnosed through computed tomography, magneticresonance or transfontanellar ultrasound. A random selection of the 169 exposedchildren led to a subgroup of 120 children who were paired with children from theLive Birth Information System, according to birthdate, residence in the samestreet or neighborhood, and gestational age, resulting in 115 subjects in thenon-exposed group. Following recruitment and before the participants completed 42months, three measures were applied to assess cognitive, motor, and languageperformance, corresponding to three home visits. Social characteristics of thefamilies and children, and the neurocognitive development of the children will becompared across the CZS exposed group (n = 147), the typical children with noexposure to CZS (n = 115) and the STORCH exposed group (Syphilis, Toxoplasmagondii, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex) (n = 20). Primary HealthCare (PHC) should include long-term care strategies for the care of children and family members, and might benefit from the research, teaching, and extensionactivities provided in this study. In the face of the consequences of the Zikavirus epidemic, an opportunity arose to intervene in the integrated care of childdevelopment within PHC, including, on an equal basis, typical children and those with delays or disabilities in the first six years of life.

LID - 10.3390/jcm11051351 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in Uganda in 1947 and was originally isolatedonly in Africa and Asia. After a spike of microcephaly cases in Brazil, research has closely focused on different aspects of congenital ZIKV infection. In thisreview, we evaluated many aspects of the disease in order to build its naturalhistory, with a focus on the long-term clinical and neuro-radiological outcomesin children. The authors have conducted a wide-ranging search spanning the2012-2021 period from databases PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus. Different sections reflect different points of congenital ZIKV infection syndrome: pathogenesis, prenatal diagnosis, clinical signs, neuroimaging andlong-term developmental outcomes. It emerged that pathogenesis has not been fullyclarified and that the clinical signs are not only limited to microcephaly. Giventhe current absence of treatments, we proposed schemes to optimize diagnosticprotocols in endemic countries. It is essential to know the key aspects of thisdisease to guarantee early diagnosis, even in less severe cases, and an adequate management of the main chronic problems. Considering the relatively recentdiscovery of this congenital infectious syndrome, further studies and updatedlong-term follow-up are needed to further improve management strategies for this disease.

AB  - Type I interferons (IFN-I) are essential to establish antiviral innate immunity. Unanchored (or free) polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) has been shown to regulate IFN-Iresponses. However, few unanchored poly-Ub interactors are known. To identifyfactors regulated by unanchored poly-Ub in a physiological setting, we developed an approach to isolate unanchored poly-Ub from lung tissue. We identified the RNAhelicase DHX16 as a potential pattern recognition receptor (PRR). Silencing ofDHX16 in cells and in vivo diminished IFN-I responses against influenza virus.These effects extended to members of other virus families, including Zika andSARS-CoV-2. DHX16-dependent IFN-I production requires RIG-I and unanchoredK48-poly-Ub synthesized by the E3-Ub ligase TRIM6. DHX16 recognizes a signal ininfluenza RNA segments that undergo splicing and requires its RNA helicase motif for direct, high-affinity interactions with specific viral RNAs. Our studyestablishes DHX16 as a PRR that partners with RIG-I for optimal activation ofantiviral immunity requiring unanchored poly-Ub.

AB  - We evaluated neuropathological consequences of fetal ZIKV exposure in rhesusmonkeys, a translatable animal model for human neural development, by carryingout quantitative neuroanatomical analyses of the nearly full-term brains offetuses infected with ZIKV and procedure-matched controls. For each animal, acomplete cerebral hemisphere was evaluated using immunohistochemical (IHC) andneuroanatomical techniques to detect virus, identify affected cell types, andevaluate gross neuroanatomical abnormalities. IHC staining revealed the presence of ZIKV in the frontal lobe, which contained activated microglia and showedincreased apoptosis of immature neurons. ZIKV-infected animals exhibitedmacrostructural changes within the visual pathway. Regional differences trackedwith the developmental timing of the brain, suggesting inflammatory processesrelated to viral infiltration swept through the cortex, followed by a wave ofcell death resulting in morphological changes. These findings may help explainwhy some infants born with normal sized heads during the ZIKV epidemic manifestdevelopmental challenges as they age.

TI  - Improving neurodevelopment in Zika-exposed children: A randomized controlledtrial.
PG  - e0010263
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While microcephaly is a significant adverse outcome of prenatalexposure to the Zika virus (ZIKV), subtle malformations of cortical development(MCD) have been observed in Zika-exposed children (ZEC), including delays inlanguage, cognition, and motor domains, and visual acuity deficits. Interventionswithin the first 1,000 days of life can significantly improve developmentaloutcomes. This study examined a 12-week Responsive Caregiving Intervention onneurodevelopmental outcomes in 24-30-month-old ZEC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALFINDINGS: A randomized controlled trial was implemented in Grenada, West Indiesusing an existing ZIKV cohort surveillance study. When children in that studyturned 24 months, baseline child neurodevelopmental measures and caregiverinterviews were administered. Caregivers who agreed to participate in the 12-weekResponsive Caregiving Intervention, implemented when children were 24-30 monthsof age, were randomly assigned to the Intervention or Waitlist Control group.Children in both groups were re-assessed on the neurodevelopmental measurespost-intervention. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 233 children from the ZIKVsurveillance study met inclusion criteria, of which n = 80 declinedparticipation, n = 42 did not complete the Intervention, and n = 72 missedfollow-up assessments given strict timelines in the study design. The finalsample for analysis was N = 13 children in the Intervention group and N = 26children in the Control group. A GEE model analysis showed significantly higherlanguage (p = 0.021) and positive behaviour (p = 0.005) scores for children inthe Intervention group compared to the Control group. The Intervention had amedium effect on child language (d = 0.66) and a large effect on positivebehaviour (d = 0.83). A 12-week Responsive Caregiving Intervention Programmesignificantly improves language and positive behaviour scores in 30-month-oldnormocephalic children who were exposed to ZIKV in utero. The programme provides an option for mothers of ZIKV-exposed children who are seeking an evidence-based neurodevelopmental intervention regardless of known impact of the virus oncortical formation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered withclinicaltrials.gov (NCT04697147).

AB  - In low-resource settings, resilience to infectious disease outbreaks can behindered by limited access to diagnostic tests. Here we report the results ofdouble-blinded studies of the performance of paper-based diagnostic tests for theZika and chikungunya viruses in a field setting in Latin America. The testsinvolved a cell-free expression system relying on isothermal amplification andtoehold-switch reactions, a purpose-built portable reader and onboard softwarefor computer vision-enabled image analysis. In patients suspected of infection,the accuracies and sensitivities of the tests for the Zika and chikungunyaviruses were, respectively, 98.5% (95% confidence interval, 96.2-99.6%, 268 serumsamples) and 98.5% (95% confidence interval, 91.7-100%, 65 serum samples) andapproximately 2 aM and 5 fM (both concentrations are within clinically relevantranges). The analytical specificities and sensitivities of the tests for culturedsamples of the viruses were equivalent to those of the real-time quantitativePCR. Cell-free synthetic biology tools and companion hardware can providede-centralized, high-capacity and low-cost diagnostics for use in low-resourcesettings.

TI  - The Early Warning and Response System (EWARS-TDR) for dengue outbreaks: can italso be applied to chikungunya and Zika outbreak warning?
PG  - 235
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07197-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Americas, endemic countries for Aedes-borne diseases such asdengue, chikungunya, and Zika face great challenges particularly since the recentoutbreaks of CHIKV and ZIKV, all transmitted by the same insect vectors Aedesaegypti and Ae. albopictus. The Special Program for Research and Training inTropical Diseases (TDR-WHO) has developed together with partners an Early Warningand Response System (EWARS) for dengue outbreaks based on a variety of alarmsignals with a high sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). The questionis if this tool can also be used for the prediction of Zika and chikungunyaoutbreaks. METHODOLOGY: We conducted in nine districts of Mexico and one largecity in Colombia a retrospective analysis of epidemiological data (for theoutbreak definition) and of climate and entomological data (as potential alarmindicators) produced by the national surveillance systems for dengue, chikungunyaand Zika outbreak prediction covering the following outbreak years: for dengue2012-2016, for Zika 2015-2017, for chikungunya 2014-2016. This period was dividedinto a "run in period" (to establish the "historical" pattern of the disease) andan "analysis period" (to identify sensitivity and PPV of outbreak prediction).RESULTS: In Mexico, the sensitivity of alarm signals for correctly predicting an outbreak was 100% for dengue, and 97% for Zika (chikungunya data could not beobtained in Mexico); the PPV was 83% for dengue and 100% for Zika. The timeperiod between alarm and start of the outbreak (i.e. the time available for earlyresponse activities) was for Zika 4-5 weeks. In Colombia the sensitivity of theoutbreak prediction was 92% for dengue, 93% for chikungunya and 100% for Zika;the PPV was 68% for dengue, 92% for chikungunya and 54% for Zika; the prediction distance was for dengue 3-5 weeks, for chikungunya 10-13 weeks and for Zika 6-10 weeks. CONCLUSION: EWARS demonstrated promising capability of timely diseaseoutbreak prediction with an operational design likely to improve the coordinationamong stakeholders. However, the prediction validity varied substantially across different types of diseases and appeared less optimal in low endemic settings.

TI  - Neurodevelopmental outcome of infants without central nervous system anomaliesborn to symptomatic RT-PCR ZIKV positive women.
PG  - e0009854
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009854 [doi]
AB  - An epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection began in Colombia in October 2015.Previous studies have identified a cause-effect relationship between fetalexposure to the ZIKV and the development of microcephaly and other centralnervous system (CNS) anomalies with variable degrees of neurodevelopmental delay.Less is known about the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants without CNSanomalies born to symptomatic ZIKV RT-PCR-positive women. We aimed to compare theneurodevelopmental outcome of these infants to a control group of infants withoutCNS anomalies born to asymptomatic ZIKV RT-PCR negative women who did notseroconvert during pregnancy. Participating infants were categorized according toZIKV maternal exposure. Women with symptomatology suggestive of ZIKV infectionand a positive RT-PCR for ZIKV were categorized as ZIKV-exposed. Maternalcontrols (ZIKV unexposed) from the same geographic area were subsequentlycaptured during the tail end of the epidemic through a partner project, theZIKAlliance, whose aim was to determine the prevalence of ZIKV in pregnant women.Infant survivors from these two groups of pregnant women had a neurodevelopmentalevaluation at 12, 18, and 24 months corrected age (CA). The ZIKV-exposed womenwere found to be older, had less subsidized health care, had a higher percentage of women in middle-class socioeconomic strata, had higher technical anduniversity education, were less likely to be living with a partner, and hadhigher rates of pregnancy comorbidity and premature births than ZIKV unexposedwomen. Compared to infants born to ZIKV unexposed women (unexposed), infants bornto ZIKV exposed women (exposed) were of lower gestational age and required morespeech and occupational therapy services. No differences between groups wereobserved in the proportion of cut-off scores <70 on the Bayley-III Scale at 12,18, and 24 months for motor, language, and cognitive domains. When a cut-off of<85 was used, a higher percentage of motor and cognitive impairment was observed in unexposed infants at 12 and 24 months CA, respectively. Median and IQR scoreon the Bayley-III scale showed higher scores in favor of exposed infants formotor development at 12 and 18 months CA, language at 12 months, and cognitivedomain at 12, 18, and 24 months. The adjusted median and IQR compound score ofthe difference between exposed and unexposed was higher in favor of exposedinfants at 12 to 24 months CA for motor (3.8 [95% CI 1.0 to 6.7]) and cognitivedomains (10.6 [95% CI 7.3 to 13.9]). We observed no differences in the languagedomain (1.9 [95% CI -1.2 to 5.0]). We conclude that infants with no evidence ofmicrocephaly or other CNS anomalies born to ZIKV-exposed women had normalneurodevelopment up to 24 months of CA, supporting an all-or-nothing effect with maternal ZIKV exposure. Long-term follow-up to evaluate school performance isrequired. Clinical Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02943304.

TI  - A Retrospective Overview of Zika Virus Evolution in the Midwest of Brazil.
PG  - e0015522
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00155-22 [doi]
AB  - Since the introduction of the Zika virus (ZIKV) into Brazil in 2015, itstransmission dynamics have been intensively studied in many parts of the country,although much is still unknown about its circulation in the midwestern states.Here, using nanopore technology, we obtained 23 novel partial and near-completeZIKV genomes from the state of Goias, located in the Midwest of Brazil. Genomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological approaches were used to retrospectively explorethe spatiotemporal evolution of the ZIKV-Asian genotype in this region. As alikely consequence of a gradual accumulation of herd immunity, epidemiologicaldata revealed a decline in the number of reported cases over 2018 to 2021.Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that multiple independent introductions of the Asian lineage have occurred in Goias over time and revealed a complextransmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlightthe utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understandmosquito-borne epidemics. IMPORTANCE Despite the considerable morbidity andmortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, denguefever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In thisstudy, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmissiondynamics in the state of Goias by analyzing genomic data from areas in MidwestBrazil not covered by other previous studies. Our study provides an understandingof how ZIKV initiates transmission in this region and reveals a complextransmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlightthe utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understandmosquito-borne epidemics, revealing how this toolkit can be used to helppolicymakers prioritize areas to be targeted, especially in the context of finitepublic health resources.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent stem cells that reside in the fetal and adult mammalian brain, which can self-renew and differentiate into neurons andsupporting cells. Intrinsic and extrinsic cues, from cells in the local niche andfrom distant sites, stringently orchestrates the self-renewal and differentiationcompetence of NSCs. Ample evidence supports the important role of NSCs inneuroplasticity, aging, disease, and repair of the nervous system. Indeed,activation of NSCs or their transplantation into injured areas of the centralnervous system can lead to regeneration in animal models. Viral invasion of NSCs can negatively affect neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, with consequent celldeath, impairment of cell cycle progression, early differentiation, which causeneural progenitors depletion in the cortical layer of the brain. Herein, we will review the current understanding of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of the fetalbrain and the NSCs, which are the preferential population targeted by ZIKV.Furthermore, the potential neurotropic properties of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may cause direct neurological damage, will be discussed.

AB  - Arboviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses maintained in nature in cycles that involve arthropod vectors. The arboviruses that cause disease in humans are members ofthe Bunyaviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Reoviridae families. These viralspecies have geographically and climatically restricted distributions due toparticular ecological and vector features. The main emerging arboviruses in theAmericas are dengue, zika, yellow fever (Flaviviridae), and chikungunya(Togaviridae). All of these viruses can be transmitted by the Aedes aegypti andAedes albopictus mosquitoes. Although not commonly, these infections areassociated with neurological complications, characterized mainly by hemorrhage,encephalitis, myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barresyndrome, and/or congenital malformations. This review describes the imagingfeatures of the neurological complications of these emerging arbovirusinfections.

AB  - Infections caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) have detrimental effects on humanhealth, in particular on infants. As no potent drug or vaccine is available todate to contain this viral disease, it is necessary to design inhibitors that cantarget the NS2B-NS3 protease of the ZIKV, which is mainly responsible for theproliferation of the virus inside the host cells . Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and molecular mechanics energies combined with the generalized Bornand surface area continuum solvation model (MM/GBSA) are used to understand thebinding modes and stabilities of R, KR, KKR, WKR, WKKR, YKKR, and FKKR peptideinhibitors bound to the NS3-NS2B protease. The results are compared with thecorresponding results obtained for covalent (compound 1) and non-covalent(compound 4*) peptidomimetic inhibitors . It is revealed that peptide inhibitors can bind strongly with the ZIKV protease with the DeltaGbind ranging from -12kcal/mol to -73 kcal/mol. Among these peptides, YKKR is found to make the moststable complex with the protease and fully occupy the electrostatically activesubstrate binding site. Hence, it would inhibit the protease activities of ZIKVstrongly. The residue-wise decomposition of DeltaGbind indicates that Asp75,Asp129, Tyr130, Ser135, Gly151, Asn152, Glys153, and Tyr161 of NS3 and Ser81,Asp83, and Phe84 of NS2B play a prominent role in the inhibitor binding.Therefore, any future design of inhibitors should be aimed to target theseresidues.

TI  - EVITA Dengue: a cluster-randomized controlled trial to EValuate the efficacy ofWolbachia-InfecTed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in reducing the incidence ofArboviral infection in Brazil.
PG  - 185
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-05997-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are a major global health problem, with over 2.5 billion at risk for dengue alone. There are no licensed antivirals for these infections, and safe andeffective vaccines are not yet widely available. Thus, prevention of arbovirustransmission by vector modification is a novel approach being pursued by multipleresearchers. However, the field needs high-quality evidence derived fromrandomized, controlled trials upon which to base the implementation andmaintenance of vector control programs. Here, we report the EVITA Dengue trialdesign (DMID 17-0111), which assesses the efficacy in decreasing arbovirustransmission of an innovative approach developed by the World Mosquito Programfor vector modification of Aedes mosquitoes by Wolbachia pipientis. METHODS: DMID17-0111 is a cluster-randomized trial in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with clustersdefined by primary school catchment areas. Clusters (n = 58) will be randomized1:1 to intervention (release of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) vs. control (no release). Standard vector control activities (i.e., insecticides and education campaigns for reduction of mosquito breeding sites) will continue asper current practice in the municipality. Participants (n = 3480, 60 per cluster)are children aged 6-11 years enrolled in the cluster-defining school and livingwithin the cluster boundaries who will undergo annual serologic surveillance for arboviral infection. The primary objective is to compare sero-incidence ofarboviral infection between arms. DISCUSSION: DMID 17-0111 aims to determine the efficacy of Wolbachia-infected mosquito releases in reducing human infections by arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and will complement the mountingevidence for this method from large-scale field releases and ongoing trials. The trial also represents a critical step towards robustness and rigor for how vectorcontrol methods are assessed, including the simultaneous measurement andcorrelation of entomologic and epidemiologic outcomes. Data from this trial will inform further the development of novel vector control methods. TRIALREGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04514107 .

AB  - Domestic pigs have become increasingly popular as a model for human diseases suchas neurological diseases. Drug discovery platforms have increasingly been used toidentify novel compounds that combat neurodegeneration. Currently, bioactivemolecules such as melatonin have been demonstrated to offer a neuroprotectiveeffect in several studies. However, a neurodegenerative platform to study novelcompounds in a porcine model has not been fully established. In this study,characterized porcine induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) were used for evaluation of the protective effect of melatonin against chemical and pathogenicstimulation. First, the effects of different concentrations of melatonin on theproliferation of porcine iNSCs were studied. Second, porcine iNSCs were treatedwith the appropriate concentration of melatonin prior to induced degenerationwith dimethyl sulfoxide or Zika virus (ZIKV). The results demonstrated that thepercentages of Ki67 expression in porcine iNSCs cultured in 0.1, 1, and 10 nMmelatonin were not significantly different from that in the control groups.Melatonin at 1 nM protected porcine iNSCs from DMSO-induced degeneration, asconfirmed by a dead cell exclusion assay and mitochondrial membrane potential(DeltaPsim) analysis. In addition, pretreatment with melatonin reduced thepercentage of dead porcine iNSCs after ZIKV infection. Melatonin increased theDeltaPsim, resulting in a decrease in cell degeneration. However, pretreatmentwith melatonin was unable to suppress ZIKV replication in porcine iNSCs. Inconclusion, the present study demonstrated the anti-degenerative effect ofmelatonin against DMSO- and ZIKV-induced degeneration in porcine iNSCs.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) can infect a wide range of tissues including the developmental brain of human fetus. Whether specific viral genetic variants are linked toneuropathology is incompletely understood. To address this, we haveintracranially serially passaged a clinical ZIKV isolate (SW01) in neonatal mice and discovered variants that exhibit markedly increased virulence andneurotropism. Deep sequencing analysis combining with molecular virology studies revealed that a single 67D (Aspartic acid) to N (Asparagine) substitution on Eprotein is sufficient to confer the increased virulence and neurotropism in vivo.Notably, virus clones with D67N mutation had higher viral production and causedmore severe cytopathic effect (CPE) in human neural astrocytes U251 cells invitro, indicating its potential neurological toxicity to human brain. Thesefindings revealed that a single mutation D67N on ZIKV envelope may lead to severeneuro lesion that may help to explain the neurovirulence of ZIKV and suggestmonitoring the occurrence of this mutation during nature infection may beimportant.

AB  - Flaviviruses are important arthropod-borne pathogens that represent an immenseglobal health problem. Their unprecedented epidemic rate and unpredictableclinical features underscore an urgent need for antiviral interventions.Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a natural occurring adrenal-derived steroid inthe human body that has been associated in protection against various infections.In the present study, the plaque assay based primary screening was conducted on32 synthetic derivatives of DHEA against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) toidentify potent anti-flaviviral compounds. Based on primary screening,HAAS-AV3026 and HAAS-AV3027 were selected as hits from DHEA derivatives thatexhibited strong antiviral activity against JEV (IC50 = 2.13 and 1.98 mumol/L,respectively) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (IC50 = 3.73 and 3.42 mumol/L, respectively).Mechanism study indicates that HAAS-AV3026 and HAAS-AV3027 do not exhibitinhibitory effect on flavivirus binding and entry process, while significantlyinhibit flavivirus infection at the replication stage. Moreover, indirectimmunofluorescence assay, Western blot analyses, and quantitative reversetranscription-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed a potent antiviral activity of DHEAderivatives hits against JEV and ZIKV in terms of inhibition of viral infection, protein production, and viral RNA synthesis in Vero cells. Taken together, ourresults may provide a basis for the development of new antivirals againstflaviviruses.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that can cause severe disease, but there are noapproved treatments or vaccines. A complication for flavivirus vaccinedevelopment is the potential of immunogens to enhance infection viaantibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a process mediated by poorly neutralizingand cross-reactive antibodies. Thus, there is a great need to develop immunogens that minimize the potential to elicit enhancing antibodies. Here we utilizedstructure-based protein engineering to develop "resurfaced" (rs) ZIKV immunogens based on E glycoprotein domain III (ZDIIIs), in which epitopes bound by variably neutralizing antibodies were masked by combinatorial mutagenesis. We identifiedone resurfaced ZDIII immunogen (rsZDIII-2.39) that elicited a protective butimmune-focused response. Compared to wild type ZDIII, immunization withresurfaced rsZDIII-2.39 protein nanoparticles produced fewer numbers of ZIKVEDIII antigen-reactive B cells and elicited serum that had a lower magnitude ofinduced ADE against dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) Our findings enhance ourunderstanding of the structural and functional determinants of antibodyprotection against ZIKV.

LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c00710 [doi]
AB  - Graphene- and carbon-based nanomaterials are key materials to develop advancedbiosensors for the sensitive detection of many biomarkers owing to their uniqueproperties. Biosensors have attracted increasing interest because they allowefficacious, sensitive, selective, rapid, and low-cost diagnosis. Biosensors are analytical devices based on receptors for the process of detection andtransducers for response measuring. Biosensors can be based on electrochemical,piezoelectric, thermal, and optical transduction mechanisms. Early virusidentification provides critical information about potentially effective andselective therapies, extends the therapeutic window, and thereby reducesmorbidity. The sensitivity and selectivity of graphene can be amended viafunctionalizing it or conjoining it with further materials. Amendment of theoptical and electrical features of the hybrid structure by introducingappropriate functional groups or counterparts is especially appealing for quickand easy-to-use virus detection. Various techniques for the electrochemicaldetection of viruses depending on antigen-antibody interactions or DNAhybridization are discussed in this work, and the reasons behind using grapheneand related carbon nanomaterials for the fabrication are presented and discussed.We review the existing state-of-the-art directions of graphene-basedclassifications for detecting DNA, protein, and hormone biomarkers and summarize the use of the different biosensors to detect several diseases, like cancer,Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes, to sense numerous viruses, includingSARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, rotavirus, Zika virus, and hepatitis B virus, and to detect the recent pandemic virus COVID-19. The general concepts,mechanisms of action, benefits, and disadvantages of advanced virus biosensorsare discussed to afford beneficial evidence of the creation and manufacture ofinnovative virus biosensors. We emphasize that graphene-based nanomaterials areideal candidates for electrochemical biosensor engineering due to their specialand tunable physicochemical properties.

AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) has a widespread distribution that includes bothtemperate and tropical climates. It is a potential vector of several importantworldwide arboviruses, including chikungunya, zika, and dengue, and itsgeographical distribution expands rapidly. Despite its vectorial importance, the bioecological features of this species in newly established environments arestill not very well known. Thus, this study investigated phenotypic variationsamong Ae. albopictus populations from different regions in Turkey. This is thefirst comparative morphological study of Ae. albopictus populations in Turkey.The procrustes distances phenogram derived from wing data indicates that theshape differences among some populations and the population from the Aegean coastdiffer from the Black Sea populations. Size differences were also detectedbetween some populations.

TI  - Zika virus congenital microcephaly severity classification and the association ofseverity with neuropsychomotor development.
PG  - 941-950
LID - 10.1007/s00247-022-05284-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus infection during pregnancy is linked to birth defects,most notably microcephaly, which is associated with neurodevelopmental delays.OBJECTIVE: The goals of the study were to propose a method for severityclassification of congenital microcephaly based on neuroradiologic findings ofMRI scans, and to investigate the association of severity with neuropsychomotordevelopmental scores. We also propose a semi-automated method for MRI-basedseverity classification of microcephaly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted across-sectional investigation of 42 infants born with congenital Zika infection. Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (Bayley-III) developmentalevaluations and MRI scans were carried out at ages 13-39 months (mean: 24.8months; standard deviation [SD]: 5.8 months). The severity score was generatedbased on neuroradiologist evaluations of brain malformations. Next, weestablished a distribution of Zika virus-microcephaly severity score includingmild, moderate and severe and investigated the association of severity withneuropsychomotor developmental scores. Finally, we propose a simplifiedsemi-automated procedure for estimating the severity score based only onvolumetric measures. RESULTS: The results showed a correlation of r=0.89(P<0.001) between the Zika virus-microcephaly severity score and thesemi-automated method. The trimester of infection did not correlate with thesemi-automated method. Neuropsychomotor development correlated with the severity classification based on the radiologic readings and semi-automated method; themore severe the imaging scores, the lower the neuropsychomotor developmentalscores. CONCLUSION: These severity classification methods can be used to evaluateseverity of microcephaly and possible association with developmentalconsequences. The semi-automated methods thus provide an alternative forpredicting severity of microcephaly based on only one MRI sequence.

PG  - 522-534
LID - 10.1016/j.omto.2022.01.011 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor and is generallyresistant to immunotherapy because of severe dysfunction of T cells. Noveltreatment options are critically needed to overcome the immunotherapy resistance of GBM. Here we demonstrate that Zika virus (ZIKV) treatment improves theefficacy of anti-PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy in GBM. We found that ZIKVinduces a strong pro-inflammatory response and increases CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cellintratumoral infiltration and activation in GBM mouse models. ZIKV treatment ofmice bearing GBM tumors inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival. Thesetherapeutic effects of ZIKV on GBM tumors are negated in mice depleted of Tcells. Moreover, ZIKV dramatically promotes activation of the type I interferonsignaling pathway in GBM cells. ZIKV treatment potently sensitizes GBM to PD-L1blockade and provides significant and durable survival benefits. Our findingsreveal that ZIKV overcomes the resistance of GBM to immune checkpoint blockade,which may lead to therapeutic applications of ZIKV in individuals with GBMreceiving immunotherapy.

AB  - RNA viruses are responsible for several infectious diseases, including denguefever, Zika fever, and COVID-19. Reverse genetics is a powerful tool to elucidatewhich domain or mutations in RNA viruses determine their pathogenicity andability to evade antiviral drugs and host immune response. Previous reversegenetics systems for flaviviruses and coronaviruses have been technicallychallenging and time-consuming, thereby hampering the further understanding ofevents during viral evolution. A novel reverse genetics system-circularpolymerase extension reaction (CPER)-has been developed to overcome thislimitation. CPER is based on PCR-mediated assembly of DNA fragments that encodethe whole genome of these viruses. CPER requires a relatively short time tointroduce specific mutations into the viral genome of flaviviruses andSARS-CoV-2. In this review article, we explain the mode of action of this system and discuss the future direction of reverse genetics for RNA viruses.

LID - 435 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020435 [doi]
AB  - Emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne viral diseases impose a significantburden on global public health. The most common mosquito-borne viruses causingrecent epidemics include flaviviruses in the family Flaviviridae, includingDengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) andWest Nile virus (WNV) and Togaviridae viruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV).Several factors may have contributed to the recent re-emergence and spread ofmosquito-borne viral diseases. Among these important causes are the evolution of mosquito-borne viruses and the genetic mutations that make them more adaptive andvirulent, leading to widespread epidemics. RNA viruses tend to acquire geneticdiversity due to error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, thus promoting highmutation rates that support adaptation to environmental changes or host immunity.In this review, we discuss recent findings on the adaptive evolution ofmosquito-borne viruses and their impact on viral infectivity, pathogenicity,vector fitness, transmissibility, epidemic potential and disease emergence.

TI  - Targeting Host PIM Protein Kinases Reduces Mayaro Virus Replication.
LID - 422 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020422 [doi]
AB  - Mayaro virus (MAYV) manipulates cell machinery to successfully replicate. Thus,identifying host proteins implicated in MAYV replication represents anopportunity to discover potential antiviral targets. PIM kinases are enzymes thatregulate essential cell functions and also appear to be critical factors in thereplication of certain viruses. In this study we explored the consequences of PIMkinase inhibition in the replication of MAYV and other arboviruses. Cytopathiceffects or viral titers in samples from MAYV-, Chikungunya-, Una- orZika-infected cells treated with PIM kinase inhibitors were evaluated using aninverted microscope or plaque-forming assays. The expression of viral proteins E1and nsP1 in MAYV-infected cells was assessed using an immunofluorescence confocalmicroscope or Western blot. Our results revealed that PIM kinase inhibitionpartially prevented MAYV-induced cell damage and also promoted a decrease inviral titers for MAYV, UNAV and ZIKV. The inhibitory effect of PIM kinaseblocking was observed for each of the MAYV strains tested and also occurred aslate as 8 h post infection (hpi). Finally, PIM kinase inhibition suppressed theexpression of MAYV E1 and nsP1 proteins. Taken together, these findings suggestthat PIM kinases could represent an antiviral target for MAYV and otherarboviruses.

LID - 10.3390/v14020401 [doi]
AB  - In the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, mRNA vaccines hold great promise because of their low risk of insertional mutagenesis, high potency,accelerated development cycles, and potential for low-cost manufacture. In pastyears, several mRNA vaccines have entered clinical trials and have shown promise for offering solutions to combat emerging and re-emerging infectious diseasessuch as rabies, Zika, and influenza. Recently, the successful application of mRNAvaccines against COVID-19 has further validated the platform and opened thefloodgates to mRNA vaccine's potential in infectious disease prevention,especially in the veterinary field. In this review, we describe our currentunderstanding of the mRNA vaccines and the technologies used for mRNA vaccinedevelopment. We also provide an overview of mRNA vaccines developed for animalinfectious diseases and discuss directions and challenges for the futureapplications of this promising vaccine platform in the veterinary field.

TI  - Vav Proteins in Development of the Brain: A Potential Relationship to thePathogenesis of Congenital Zika Syndrome?
LID - 386 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020386 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can result in a significant impacton the brain and eye of the developing fetus, termed congenital zika syndrome(CZS). At a morphological level, the main serious presentations of CZS aremicrocephaly and retinal scarring. At a cellular level, many cell types of thebrain may be involved, but primarily neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) anddeveloping neurons. Vav proteins have guanine exchange activity in converting GDPto GTP on proteins such as Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA to stimulate intracellularsignaling pathways. These signaling pathways are known to play important roles inmaintaining the polarity and self-renewal of NPC pools by coordinating theformation of adherens junctions with cytoskeletal rearrangements. In developingneurons, these same pathways are adopted to control the formation and growth ofneurites and mediate axonal guidance and targeting in the brain and retina. This review describes the role of Vavs in these processes and highlights the points ofpotential ZIKV interaction, such as (i) the binding and entry of ZIKV in cellsvia TAM receptors, which may activate Vav/Rac/RhoA signaling; (ii) the functionalconvergence of ZIKV NS2A with Vav in modulating adherens junctions; (iii) ZIKVNS4A/4B protein effects on PI3K/AKT in a regulatory loop via PPI3 to influenceVav/Rac1 signaling in neurite outgrowth; and (iv) the induction of SOCS1 andUSP9X following ZIKV infection to regulate Vav protein degradation or activation,respectively, and impact Vav/Rac/RhoA signaling in NPC and neurons. Experimentsto define these interactions will further our understanding of the molecularbasis of CZS and potentially other developmental disorders stemming from in uteroinfections. Additionally, Vav/Rac/RhoA signaling pathways may present tractabletargets for therapeutic intervention or molecular rationale for disease severity in CZS.

TI  - Zika Virus Infection of Sertoli Cells Alters Protein Expression Involved inActivated Immune and Antiviral Response Pathways, Carbohydrate Metabolism andCardiovascular Disease.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging virus, causes congenital brain abnormalities andGuillain-Barre syndrome. It is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, butinfections are also linked to sexual transmissions. Infectious ZIKV has beenisolated, and viral RNA has been detected in semen over a year after the onset ofinitial symptoms, but the mode of long-term persistence is not yet understood.ZIKV can proliferate in human Sertoli cells (HSerC) for several weeks in vitro,suggesting that it might be a reservoir for persistent ZIKV infection. This studydetermined proteomic changes in HSerC during ZIKV infections by TMT-massspectrometry analysis. Levels of 4416 unique Sertoli cell proteins weresignificantly altered at 3, 5, and 7 days after ZIKV infection. The significantlyaltered proteins include enzymes, transcription regulators, transporters,kinases, peptidases, transmembrane receptors, cytokines, ion channels, and growthfactors. Many of these proteins are involved in pathways associated withantiviral response, antigen presentation, and immune cell activation. Severalimmune response pathway proteins were significantly activated during infection,e.g., interferon signaling, T cell receptor signaling, IL-8 signaling, and Th1signaling. The altered protein levels were linked to predicted activation ofimmune response in HSerC, which was predicted to suppress ZIKV infection. ZIKVinfection also affected the levels of critical regulators of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways such as phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, andenolase. Interestingly, many significantly altered proteins were associated with cardiac hypertrophy, which may induce heart failure in infected patients. Insummary, our research contributes to a better understanding of ZIKV replicationdynamics and infection in Sertoli cells.

TI  - Zika Virus Immunoglobulin G Seroprevalence among Young Adults Living with HIV or without HIV in Thailand from 1997 to 2017.
LID - 368 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020368 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemiological data in Thailand are limited. We assessed ZIKV IgG seroprevalence among young adults during 1997-2017 and determined factorsassociated with ZIKV IgG seropositivity. This retrospective laboratory studyincluded randomly selected subjects aged 18-25 years participating in largeclinical studies conducted in Thailand during 1997-2017. Stored plasma sampleswere analyzed for ZIKV IgG using an ELISA test (Anti-Zika Virus IgG, EUROIMMUN,Lubeck, Germany). Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data were used inunivariable and multivariable analyses to identify factors associated with ZIKVIgG positivity. Of the 1648 subjects included, 1259 were pregnant women, 844 wereliving with HIV and 111 were living with HBV. ZIKV IgG seroprevalence was similaramong the HIV-infected and -uninfected pregnant women (22.8% vs. 25.8%, p-value =0.335) and was overall stable among the pregnant women, with a 25.2% prevalence. Factors independently associated with ZIKV IgG positivity included an age of23-25 years as compared to 18-20 years, an HIV RNA load below 3.88 log10copies/mL and birth in regions outside northern Thailand. Our study shows that a large proportion of the population in Thailand probably remains susceptible toZIKV infection, which could be the ground for future outbreaks. Continuedsurveillance of ZIKV spread in Thailand is needed to inform public healthpolicies.

TI  - Diphyllin Shows a Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity against Multiple MedicallyImportant Enveloped RNA and DNA Viruses.
LID - 354 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020354 [doi]
AB  - Diphyllin is a natural arylnaphtalide lignan extracted from tropical plants ofparticular importance in traditional Chinese medicine. This compound has beendescribed as a potent inhibitor of vacuolar (H(+))ATPases and hence of theendosomal acidification process that is required by numerous enveloped viruses totrigger their respective viral infection cascades after entering host cells byreceptor-mediated endocytosis. Accordingly, we report here a revised, updated,and improved synthesis of diphyllin, and demonstrate its antiviral activitiesagainst a panel of enveloped viruses from Flaviviridae, Phenuiviridae,Rhabdoviridae, and Herpesviridae families. Diphyllin is not cytotoxic for Veroand BHK-21 cells up to 100 microM and exerts a sub-micromolar or low-micromolarantiviral activity against tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zikavirus, Rift Valley fever virus, rabies virus, and herpes-simplex virus type 1.Our study shows that diphyllin is a broad-spectrum host cell-targeting antiviral agent that blocks the replication of multiple phylogenetically unrelatedenveloped RNA and DNA viruses. In support of this, we also demonstrate thatdiphyllin is more than just a vacuolar (H(+))ATPase inhibitor but may employother antiviral mechanisms of action to inhibit the replication cycles of thoseviruses that do not enter host cells by endocytosis followed by low pH-dependent membrane fusion.

LID - 10.3390/v14020346 [doi]
AB  - Flavivirus outbreaks require fast and reliable diagnostics that can be easilyadapted to newly emerging and re-emerging flaviviruses. Due to the serologicalcross-reactivity among flavivirus antibodies, neutralization tests (NT) areconsidered the gold standard for sero-diagnostics. Here, we first establishedwild-type single-round infectious virus replicon particles (VRPs) by packaging a yellow fever virus (YFV) replicon expressing Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) with YFVstructural proteins in trans using a double subgenomic Sindbis virus (SINV)replicon. The latter expressed the YFV envelope proteins prME via the first SINV subgenomic promoter and the capsid protein via a second subgenomic SINV promoter.VRPs were produced upon co-electroporation of replicon and packaging RNA.Introduction of single restriction enzyme sites in the packaging constructflanking the prME sequence easily allowed to exchange the prME moiety resultingin chimeric VRPs that have the surface proteins of other flaviviruses includingdengue virus 1--4, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitisvirus. Besides comparing the YF-VRP based NT assay to a YF reporter virus NTassay, we analyzed the neutralization efficiencies of different humananti-flavivirus sera or a monoclonal antibody against all established VRPs. Theassays were performed in a 96-well high-throughput format setting with Gluc asreadout in comparison to classical plaque reduction NTs indicating that theVRP-based NT assays are suitable for high-throughput analyses of neutralizingflavivirus antibodies.

TI  - DDX50 Is a Viral Restriction Factor That Enhances IRF3 Activation.
LID - 316 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020316 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kappaB are crucial in innate immunesignalling in response to many viral and bacterial pathogens. However, mechanismsleading to their activation remain incompletely understood. Viral RNA can bedetected by RLR receptors, such as RIG-I and MDA5, and the dsRNA receptor TLR3.Alternatively, the DExD-Box RNA helicases DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 activateIRF3/NF-kappaB in a TRIF-dependent manner independent of RIG-I, MDA5, or TLR3.Here, we describe DDX50, which shares 55.6% amino acid identity with DDX21, as a non-redundant factor that promotes activation of the IRF3 signalling pathwayfollowing its stimulation with viral RNA or infection with RNA and DNA viruses.Deletion of DDX50 in mouse and human cells impaired IRF3 phosphorylation andIRF3-dependent endogenous gene expression and cytokine/chemokine production inresponse to cytoplasmic dsRNA (polyIC transfection), and infection by RNA and DNAviruses. Mechanistically, whilst DDX50 co-immunoprecipitated TRIF, it actedindependently to the previously described TRIF-dependent RNA sensor DDX1. Indeed,shRNA-mediated depletion of DDX1 showed DDX1 was dispensable for signalling inresponse to RNA virus infection. Importantly, loss of DDX50 resulted in asignificant increase in replication and dissemination of virus followinginfection with vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus, or Zika virus, highlighting its important role as a broad-ranging viral restriction factor.

TI  - Dengue and Zika Virus Capsid Proteins Contain a Common PEX19-Binding Motif.
LID - 253 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020253 [doi]
AB  - Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have evolvedsophisticated mechanisms to suppress the host immune system. For instance,flavivirus infections were found to sabotage peroxisomes, organelles with animportant role in innate immunity. The current model suggests that the capsid (C)proteins of DENV and ZIKV downregulate peroxisomes, ultimately resulting inreduced production of interferons by interacting with the host protein PEX19, acrucial chaperone in peroxisomal biogenesis. Here, we aimed to explore theimportance of peroxisomes and the role of C interaction with PEX19 in theflavivirus life cycle. By infecting cells lacking peroxisomes we show that thisorganelle is required for optimal DENV replication. Moreover, we demonstrate thatDENV and ZIKV C bind PEX19 through a conserved PEX19-binding motif, which is alsocommonly found in cellular peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). However, incontrast to PMPs, this interaction does not result in the targeting of C toperoxisomes. Furthermore, we show that the presence of C results in peroxisomeloss due to impaired peroxisomal biogenesis, which appears to occur by aPEX19-independent mechanism. Hence, these findings challenge the current model ofhow flavivirus C might downregulate peroxisomal abundance and suggest a yetunknown role of peroxisomes in flavivirus biology.

AB  - High levels of T helper 17 cell (Th17)-related cytokines have been shown in acuteZika virus (ZIKV) infection. We hypothesized that the high levels of Th17-relatedcytokines, associated with a regulatory environment during pregnancy, create afavorable milieu for the differentiation of CD4+Th17 cells. We present data from a cross-sectional study on mothers who confirmed ZIKV infection by qRT-PCR andtheir children. We also recruited non-pregnant women infected with ZIKV in thesame period. ZIKV infection occurred between 2015 and 2017. We collected samples for this study between 2018 and 2019, years after the initial infection. Wehighlight that, after in vitro stimulation with ZIKV CD4 megapool (ZIKV MP), wefound a lower frequency of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells (Th17), especially in themothers, confirmed by the decrease in IL-17 production in the supernatant.However, a higher frequency of CD4+ IL-17+ IFN-gamma+ T cells (Th1Th17)responding to the ZIKV MP was observed in the cells of the mothers and childrenbut not in those of the non-pregnant women. Our data indicate that the priming ofCD4 T cells of the Th1Th17 phenotype occurred preferentially in the mothers whogave birth to children with CZS and in the children.

LID - 10.3390/v14020242 [doi]
AB  - Arboviral infections such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV)are a major disease burden in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and there are no effective vaccinations or therapeutic drugs available at this time.Understanding the role of the T cell response is very important when designingeffective vaccines. Currently, comprehensive identification of T cell epitopesduring a DENV infection shows that CD8 and CD4 T cells and their specificphenotypes play protective and pathogenic roles. The protective role of CD8 Tcells in DENV is carried out through the killing of infected cells and theproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, as CD4 T cells enhance B cell and CD8 T cell activities. A limited number of studies attempted to identify theinvolvement of T cells in CHIKV and ZIKV infection. The identification of humanimmunodominant ZIKV viral epitopes responsive to specific T cells is scarce, and none have been identified for CHIKV. In CHIKV infection, CD8 T cells areactivated during the acute phase in the lymph nodes/blood, and CD4 T cells areactivated during the chronic phase in the joints/muscles. Studies on the role of T cells in ZIKV-neuropathogenesis are limited and need to be explored. Manystudies have shown the modulating actions of T cells due to cross-reactivitybetween DENV-ZIKV co-infections and have repeated heterologous/homologous DENVinfection, which is an important factor to consider when developing an effective vaccine.

AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are important vectors of several debilitating and deadlyarthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, including Yellow Fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Arbovirus transmission occurs when an infected mosquito probes the host's skin in search of a blood meal. Salivary proteins frommosquitoes help to acquire blood and have also been shown to enhance pathogentransmission in vivo and in vitro. Here, we evaluated the interaction of mosquitosalivary proteins with ZIKV by surface plasmon resonance and enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay. We found that three salivary proteins AAEL000793,AAEL007420, and AAEL006347 bind to the envelope protein of ZIKV with nanomolaraffinities. Similar results were obtained using virus-like particles in bindingassays. These interactions have no effect on viral replication in culturedendothelial cells and keratinocytes. Additionally, we found detectable antibodylevels in ZIKV and DENV serum samples against the recombinant proteins thatinteract with ZIKV. These results highlight complex interactions between viruses,salivary proteins and antibodies that could be present during viraltransmissions.

AB  - The transmission of dengue and other medically important mosquito-borne virusesin the westernmost region of Indonesia is not well described. We assessed dengue and Zika virus seroprevalence in Aceh province, the westernmost area of theIndonesian archipelago. Serum samples collected from 199 randomly sampled healthyresidents of Aceh Jaya in 2017 were analyzed for neutralizing antibodies byplaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Almost all study participants(198/199; 99.5%) presented with multitypic profiles of neutralizing antibodies totwo or more DENV serotypes, indicating transmission of multiple DENV in theregion prior to 2017. All residents were exposed to one or more DENV serotypes bythe age of 30 years. The highest geometric mean titers were measured for DENV-4, followed by DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. Among a subset of 116 sera, 27 neutralizedZIKV with a high stringency (20 with PRNT90 > 10 and 7 with PRNT90 > 40). Thisstudy showed that DENV is hyperendemic in the westernmost region of theIndonesian archipelago and suggested that ZIKV may have circulated prior to 2017.

TI  - Was It Chikungunya? Laboratorial and Clinical Investigations of Cases Occurredduring a Triple Arboviruses' Outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
LID - 245 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11020245 [doi]
AB  - The co-circulation of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and Zikavirus (ZIKV) in Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil, caused a challenging tripleepidemic, as they share similar clinical signs and symptoms and geographicaldistribution. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical and laboratorial aspectsof chikungunya suspected cases assisted in RJ during the 2018 outbreak, focusing on the differential diagnosis with dengue and zika. All suspected cases weresubmitted to molecular and/or serological differential diagnostic approaches toarboviruses. A total of 242 cases suspected of arbovirus infection wereinvestigated and 73.6% (178/242) were molecular and/or serologically confirmed aschikungunya. In RT-qPCR confirmed cases, cycle threshold (Ct) values ranged from 15.46 to 35.13, with acute cases presenting lower values. Chikungunya cases were mainly in females (64%) and the most frequently affected age group was adultsbetween 46 to 59 years old (27%). Polyarthralgia affected 89% of patients,especially in hands and feet. No dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)infections were confirmed by molecular diagnosis, but 9.5% (23/242) hadserological evidence of DENV exposure by the detection of specific anti-DENV IgM or NS1, and 42.7% (76/178) of chikungunya positive cases also presented recentDENV exposure reflected by a positive anti-DENV IgM or NS1 result. Asignificantly higher frequency of arthritis (p = 0.023) and limb edema (p <0.001) was found on patients with CHIKV monoinfection compared to dengue patientsand patients exposed to both viruses. Lastly, phylogenetic analysis showed thatthe chikungunya cases were caused by the ECSA genotype. Despite the triplearboviruses' epidemic in the state of RJ, most patients with fever and arthralgiainvestigated here were diagnosed as chikungunya cases, and the incidence ofCHIKV/DENV co-detection was higher than that reported in other studies.

AB  - A series of anionic homopolymers, poly(sodium2-(acrylamido)-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate) (PAMPS) and amphiphilic copolymers ofAMPS and sodium 11-(acrylamido)undecanoate (AaU), both block (PAMPS75-b-PAaUn),and random (P(AMPSm-co-AaUn)), were synthesized and their antiviral activityagainst Zika virus (ZIKV) was evaluated. Interestingly, while the homopolymersshowed limited antiviral activity, the copolymers are very efficient antivirals. This observation was explained considering that under the conditions relevant to the biological experiments (pH 7.4 PBS buffer) the macromolecules of thesecopolymers exist as negatively charged (zeta potential about -25 mV)nanoparticles (4-12 nm) due to their self-organization. They inhibit the ZIKVreplication cycle by binding to the cell surface and thereby blocking virusattachment to host cells. Considering good solubility in aqueous media, lowtoxicity, and high selectivity index (SI) of the PAMPS-b-PAaU copolymers, theycan be considered promising agents against ZIKV infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to get the overall picture about theknowledge of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases in public in Guangzhouand provide a scientific basis for developing health information strategies.METHODS: We used the structured questionnaire to interview 1,000 Guangzhouresidents by health enquiry hotline. Descriptive analysis was presented toevaluate the knowledge of the participants. Multiple logistic regression modelwas performed to determine the influence factors for knowledge of emerging andreemerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: A total of 801 individuals completed thesurvey. About one-third had heard of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Zika, whereas Ebola and plague about 50%. A total of 32.08% participants hadnever heard of any of the four diseases. Only 2.08% knew the sexual transmission of Zika and 90.17% had no idea about the epidemic region of plague. No more than 15% knew they should check their health status after returning from the epidemic region. Education level and income were the key factors that influenced knowledgerate. CONCLUSIONS: The low-level knowledge called for the improvement in healthinformation to the public, especially those with low level of education andincome. Effective and precise health information was urged to carry out toimprove the prevention for the emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.

TI  - Plant-Derived Recombinant Vaccines against Zoonotic Viruses.
LID - 156 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12020156 [doi]
AB  - Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases cause serious illness with billions ofcases, and millions of deaths. The most effective way to restrict the spread ofzoonotic viruses among humans and animals and prevent disease is vaccination.Recombinant proteins produced in plants offer an alternative approach for thedevelopment of safe, effective, inexpensive candidate vaccines. Currentstrategies are focused on the production of highly immunogenic structuralproteins, which mimic the organizations of the native virion but lack the viralgenetic material. These include chimeric viral peptides, subunit virus proteins, and virus-like particles (VLPs). The latter, with their ability to self-assemble and thus resemble the form of virus particles, are gaining traction amongplant-based candidate vaccines against many infectious diseases. In this review, we summarized the main zoonotic diseases and followed the progress in using plantexpression systems for the production of recombinant proteins and VLPs used inthe development of plant-based vaccines against zoonotic viruses.

TI  - A Split NanoLuc Reporter Quantitatively Measures Circular RNA IRES Translation.
LID - 357 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13020357 [doi]
AB  - Internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) are RNA secondary structures that mediate translation independent from the m7G RNA cap. The dicistronic luciferase assay isthe most frequently used method to measure IRES-mediated translation. While this assay is quantitative, it requires numerous controls and can be time-consuming.Circular RNAs generated by splinted ligation have been shown to also accuratelyreport on IRES-mediated translation, however suffer from low yield and otherchallenges. More recently, cellular sequences were shown to facilitate RNA circleformation through backsplicing. Here, we used a previously published backsplicingcircular RNA split GFP reporter to create a highly sensitive and quantitativesplit nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) reporter. We show that NanoLuc expression requiresbacksplicing and correct orientation of a bona fide IRES. In response to cellstress, IRES-directed NanoLuc expression remained stable or increased while acapped control reporter decreased in translation. In addition, we detectedNanoLuc expression from putative cellular IRESs and the Zika virus 5'untranslated region that is proposed to harbor IRES function. These data togethershow that our IRES reporter construct can be used to verify, identify andquantify the ability of sequences to mediate IRES-translation within a circularRNA.

TI  - A Journey into the Clinical Relevance of Heme Oxygenase 1 for Human Inflammatory Disease and Viral Clearance: Why Does It Matter on the COVID-19 Scene?
LID - 276 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11020276 [doi]
AB  - Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, isinvolved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, exerting a cytoprotectiverole by its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory functions. HO-1 and its endproducts, biliverdin, carbon monoxide and free iron (Fe(2+)), confercytoprotection against inflammatory and oxidative injury. Additionally, HO-1exerts antiviral properties against a diverse range of viral infections byinterfering with replication or activating the interferon (IFN) pathway. Severecases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused bysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are characterizedby systemic hyperinflammation, which, in some cases, leads to severe or fatalsymptoms as a consequence of respiratory failure, lung and heart damage, kidneyfailure, and nervous system complications. This review summarizes the currentresearch on the protective role of HO-1 in inflammatory diseases and against awide range of viral infections, positioning HO-1 as an attractive target toameliorate clinical manifestations during COVID-19.

LID - 10.3390/cells11040730 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) threatens almost 70% of the world's population, with noeffective therapeutic currently available and controversy surrounding the oneapproved vaccine. A key factor in dengue viral replication is the interactionbetween DENV nonstructural proteins (NS) 5 and 3 (NS3) in the infected cell.Here, we perform a proof-of-principle high-throughput screen to identifycompounds targeting the NS5-NS3 binding interface. We use a range of approachesto show for the first time that two small molecules-repurposed drugs I-OMetyrphostin AG538 (I-OMe-AG238) and suramin hexasodium (SHS)-inhibit NS5-NS3binding at low muM concentration through direct binding to NS5 that impactsthermostability. Importantly, both have strong antiviral activity at low muMconcentrations against not only DENV-2, but also Zika virus (ZIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV). This work highlights the NS5-NS3 binding interface as a viabletarget for the development of anti-flaviviral therapeutics.

TI  - Isarubrolone C Promotes Autophagic Degradation of Virus Proteins via ActivatingATG10S in HepG2 Cells.
PG  - 1018-1028

AB  - Isarubrolone C is a bioactive polycyclic tropoloalkaloid from Streptomyces. Ourprevious study showed that isarubrolone C could trigger autophagy. Here, wereport isarubrolone C potential in broad-spectrum antiviral effect and itsantiviral mechanism in vitro. Our results show that isarubrolone C activatedautophagy and reduced levels of viral proteins in the cells harboringHCV-CORE/NS5B, HBx, ZIKV-NS5, and HIV-RT, respectively. The role of isarubrolone C in suppression of the viral proteins was via an autophagic degradation pathway rather than a proteasome pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed thatisarubrolone C promoted both autophagy flux opening and the viral proteins being enwrapped in autolysosomes. PCR assays showed that isarubrolone C elevated thetranscription levels of ATG10/ATG10S and IL28A. Further, ATG10S high expressioncould efficiently enhance IL28A expression and the ability of isarubrolone C todegrade the viral proteins by promoting the colocalization of viral proteins withautolysosomes. Additionally, knockdown of endogenous IL28A caused both losses of the isarubrolone C antiviral effect and autolysosome formation. These resultsindicate that the role of isarubrolone C antiviruses is achieved by triggeringthe autophagic mechanism, which is mediated by endogenous ATG10S and IL28Aactivation. This is the first report about isarubrolone C potential of in vitrobroad-spectrum antiviruses.

TI  - Observed poleward freshwater transport since 1970.
PG  - 617-622

AB  - Warming-induced global water cycle changes pose a significant challenge to globalecosystems and human society. However, quantifying historical water cycle change is difficult owing to a dearth of direct observations, particularly over theocean, where 77% and 85% of global precipitation and evaporation occur,respectively(1-3). Air-sea fluxes of freshwater imprint on ocean salinity suchthat mean salinity is lowest in the warmest and coldest parts of the ocean, andis highest at intermediate temperatures(4). Here we track salinity trends in the warm, salty fraction of the ocean, and quantify the observed net polewardtransport of freshwater in the Earth system from 1970 to 2014. Over this period, poleward freshwater transport from warm to cold ocean regions has occurred at arate of 34-62 milli-sverdrups (mSv = 10(3) m(3) s(-1)), a rate that is notreplicated in the current generation of climate models (the Climate ModelIntercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)). In CMIP6 models, surface freshwaterflux intensification in warm ocean regions leads to an approximately equivalentchange in ocean freshwater content, with little impact from ocean mixing andcirculation. Should this partition of processes hold for the real world, theimplication is that the historical surface flux amplification is weaker(0.3-4.6%) in CMIP6 compared with observations (3.0-7.4%). These resultsestablish a historical constraint on poleward freshwater transport that willassist in addressing biases in climate models.

TI  - Mortality from Congenital Zika Syndrome - Nationwide Cohort Study in Brazil.
PG  - 757-767
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2101195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to Zika virus has potential teratogenic effects,with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation referred to as congenital Zikasyndrome. Data on survival among children with congenital Zika syndrome arelimited. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used linked,routinely collected data in Brazil, from January 2015 through December 2018, toestimate mortality among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome ascompared with those without the syndrome. Kaplan-Meier curves and survival modelswere assessed with adjustment for confounding and with stratification accordingto gestational age, birth weight, and status of being small for gestational age. RESULTS: A total of 11,481,215 live-born children were followed to 36 months ofage. The mortality rate was 52.6 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.6 to58.0) per 1000 person-years among live-born children with congenital Zikasyndrome, as compared with 5.6 deaths (95% CI, 5.6 to 5.7) per 1000 person-years among those without the syndrome. The mortality rate ratio among live-bornchildren with congenital Zika syndrome, as compared with those without thesyndrome, was 11.3 (95% CI, 10.2 to 12.4). Among infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight of less than 1500 g, the risks of death weresimilar regardless of congenital Zika syndrome status. Among infants born atterm, those with congenital Zika syndrome were 14.3 times (95% CI, 12.4 to 16.4) as likely to die as those without the syndrome (mortality rate, 38.4 vs. 2.7deaths per 1000 person-years). Among infants with a birth weight of 2500 g orgreater, those with congenital Zika syndrome were 12.9 times (95% CI, 10.9 to15.3) as likely to die as those without the syndrome (mortality rate, 32.6 vs.2.5 deaths per 1000 person-years). The burden of congenital anomalies, diseasesof the nervous system, and infectious diseases as recorded causes of deaths washigher among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome than among thosewithout the syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death was higher among live-bornchildren with congenital Zika syndrome than among those without the syndrome and persisted throughout the first 3 years of life.

LID - 10.1007/s10479-022-04523-8 [doi]
AB  - This paper analyses the volatility transmission between European GlobalSystematically Important Banks (GSIBs) and implied stock market volatility. ADynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive ConditionalHeteroskedasticity model is applied to determine the dynamic correlation between returns of Europe's GSIBs and the world's most prominent measure of market"fear", the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The results identify a higher negativeco-relationship between the VIX and GSIB returns during the COVID-19 periodcompared with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), with one-day lagged changes inthe VIX negatively Granger-causing bank returns. The asymmetric impact of changesin implied volatility is examined by quantile regressions, with the findingsshowing that in the lower quartile-where extreme negative bank returns arepresent-jumps in the VIX are highly significant. This effect is more pronouncedduring COVID-19 than during the GFC. Additional robustness analysis shows thatthese findings are consistent during the periods of the Swine Flu and Zika virus epidemics.

TI  - Host cytoskeletal vimentin serves as a structural organizer and an RNA-bindingprotein regulator to facilitate Zika viral replication.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.2113909119 [doi]
AB  - Emerging microbe infections, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), pose an increasing threatto human health. Investigations on ZIKV replication have revealed theconstruction of replication complexes (RCs), but the role of cytoskeleton in thisprocess is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function of cytoskeletalintermediate filament protein vimentin in the life cycle of ZIKV infection. Usingadvanced imaging techniques, we uncovered that vimentin filaments undergo drasticreorganization upon viral protein synthesis to form a perinuclear cage-likestructure that embraces and concentrates RCs. Genetic removal of vimentinmarkedly disrupted the integrity of RCs and resulted in fragmented subcellulardispersion of viral proteins. This led to reduced viral genome replication, viralprotein production, and release of infectious virions, without interrupting viralbinding and entry. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and RNA-sequencing screensidentified interactions and interplay between vimentin and hundreds ofendoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident RNA-binding proteins. Among them, thecytoplasmic-region of ribosome receptor binding protein 1, an ER transmembraneprotein that directly binds viral RNA, interacted with and was regulated byvimentin, resulting in modulation of ZIKV replication. Together, the data in our work reveal a dual role for vimentin as a structural element for RC integrity andas an RNA-binding-regulating hub during ZIKV infection, thus unveiling a layer ofinterplay between Zika virus and host cell.

TI  - Searching for plant-derived antivirals against dengue virus and Zika virus.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/s12985-022-01751-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide epidemics of diseases as dengue and Zika have triggeredan intense effort to repurpose drugs and search for novel antivirals to treatpatients as no approved drugs for these diseases are currently available. Our aimwas to screen plant-derived extracts to identify and isolate compounds withantiviral properties against dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). METHODS: Seven thousand plant extracts were screened in vitro for their antiviralproperties against DENV-2 and ZIKV by their viral cytopathic effect reductionfollowed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) method, previously validated for this purpose. Selected extracts weresubmitted to bioactivity-guided fractionation using high- and ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography. In parallel, high-resolution mass spectrometric data (MSn)were collected from each fraction, allowing compounds into the active fractionsto be tracked in subsequent fractionation procedures. The virucidal activity ofextracts and compounds was assessed by using the plaque reduction assay. EC50 andCC50 were determined by dose response experiments, and the ratio (EC50/CC50) was used as a selectivity index (SI) to measure the antiviral vs. cytotoxic activity.Purified compounds were used in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy toidentify their chemical structures. Two compounds were associated in differentproportions and submitted to bioassays against both viruses to investigatepossible synergy. In silico prediction of the pharmacokinetic and toxicity(ADMET) properties of the antiviral compounds were calculated using the pkCSMplatform. RESULTS: We detected antiviral activity against DENV-2 and ZIKV in 21extracts obtained from 15 plant species. Hippeastrum (Amaryllidaceae) was themost represented genus, affording seven active extracts. Bioactivity-guidedfractionation of several extracts led to the purification of lycorine,pretazettine, narciclasine, and narciclasine-4-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside (NXP).Another 16 compounds were identified in active fractions. Association of lycorineand pretazettine did not improve their antiviral activity against DENV-2 andneither to ZIKV. ADMET prediction suggested that these four compounds may have a good metabolism and no mutagenic toxicity. Predicted oral absorption,distribution, and excretion parameters of lycorine and pretazettine indicate themas candidates to be tested in animal models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed thatplant extracts, especially those from the Hippeastrum genus, can be a valuablesource of antiviral compounds against ZIKV and DENV-2. The majority of compounds identified have never been previously described for their activity against ZIKVand other viruses.

TI  - Rapid Decline of Zika Virus IgM Antibodies against the NS1 Protein in ImportedIsraeli Cases.
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-0099 [doi]
LID - tpmd210099 [pii]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy may cause severe fetal abnormalitiesand therefore it is important to diagnose and distinguish between recent and pastZika infection. Serological diagnosis assays detect antibodies against theenvelope protein, that suffer from high cross-reactivity. In addition, reportsregarding long IgM persistence prevent its use in diagnosis of recent Zikainfection. Following the Zika pandemic, a novel ELISA assay based on detection ofantibodies against Zika nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein was developed (NS1-IgM).Here, NS1-IgM antibodies were assessed in Israeli travelers diagnosed with Zika. NS1-IgM and NS1-IgG antibodies from 36 travelers diagnosed with ZIKV infectionwere detected as early as 5 days after symptom onset. However, while IgG levelswere maintained for several months, IgM levels in all samples declined rapidlyand by 31 days after symptom onset, no IgM positive samples were detected.Interval-censored survival analysis demonstrated 25%, 50%, and 75% decline inNS1-IgM levels in 29 days (95% CI: 22-34), 34 days (95% CI: 29-44), and 44 days(95% CI: 34-65), respectively. Our results suggest that IgM antibodies againstZIKV NS1 are short lived and can be used as a reliable marker for diagnosis ofrecent ZIKV infection.

AB  - Diseases caused by viruses of the genus Flavivirus are among the main diseasesthat affect the world and they are a serious public health problem. Three of themstand out: Dengue, Yellow fever and Zika viruses. The non-structural protein 1(NS1), encoded by this viral genus, in its dimeric form, plays important roles inthe pathogenesis and RNA replication of these viruses. Therefore, theidentification of chemicals with the potential to inhibit the formation of theNS1 protein dimer of DENV, YFV and ZIKV would enable them to act as amulti-target drug. For this, we selected conformations of the NS1 protein monomerwith similar beta-roll domain structure among the three virus species fromconformations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations performed in GROMACSin 5 replicates of 150 ns for each species. After selecting the proteinstructures, a virtual screening of compounds from the natural products catalog ofthe ZINC database was performed using AutoDock Vina. The 100 best compounds were classified according efficiency criteria. Two compounds were observed in commonto the species, with energy scores ranging from -9.2 kcal/mol to -10.1 kcal/mol. The results obtained here demonstrate the high similarity of NS1 proteins in the Flavivirus genus and high affinity for the same compounds; thus justifying thepotential of these small molecules act in multitarget therapy.Communicated byRamaswamy H.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of mathematicaltools to understand and predict outbreaks of severe infectious diseases,including arboviruses such as Zika. To this end, we introduce ARBO, a package forsimulation and analysis of arbovirus nonlinear dynamics. The implementationfollows a minimalist style, and is intuitive and extensible to many settings ofvector-borne disease outbreaks. This paper outlines the main tools that composeARBO, discusses how recent research works about the Brazilian Zika outbreak have explored the package's capabilities, and describes its potential impact forfuture works on mathematical epidemiology.

AB  - Viral infections during pregnancy are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes,including maternal and fetal mortality, pregnancy loss, premature labor, andcongenital anomalies. Mammalian gestation encounters an immunological paradoxwherein the placenta balances the tolerance of an allogeneic fetus withprotection against pathogens. Viruses cannot easily transmit from mother to fetusdue to physical and immunological barriers at the maternal-fetal interface posinga restricted threat to the fetus and newborns. Despite this, the unknownstrategies utilized by certain viruses could weaken the placental barrier totrigger severe maternal and fetal health issues especially through verticaltransmission, which was not fully understood until now. In this review, wesummarize diverse aspects of the major viral infections relevant to pregnancy,including the characteristics of pathogenesis, related maternal-fetalcomplications, and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of verticaltransmission. We highlight the fundamental signatures of complex placentaldefense mechanisms, which will prepare us to fight the next emerging andre-emerging infectious disease in the pregnancy population.

AB  - Galidesivir (BCX4430) is an adenosine nucleoside analog broadly active in cellculture against multiple RNA virus families, and active in animal models of viraldiseases associated with Ebola, Marburg, yellow fever, Zika, and Rift Valleyfever. Current studies demonstrated the pharmacokinetics and safety of thefirst-in-human evaluations of galidesivir as intramuscular (IM) and intravenous(IV) formulations. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studieswere conducted enrolling 126 healthy subjects. Study 1 evaluated the safety andtolerability of IM galidesivir over single day dosing, single day dosing +/-lidocaine, and 7-day dosing with lidocaine. Study 2 evaluated the safety andtolerability of single ascending doses of IV galidesivir. Safety and tolerabilitywere evaluated via clinical and laboratory monitoring. The plasmaconcentration-time profile of galidesivir at doses 0.3 to 10 mg/kg IM wascharacterized by rapid absorption, an initial rapid distribution and clearancephase, and an extended terminal elimination phase. The initial rapid distributionand extended terminal elimination were mimicked in the profile of galidesivir at doses 5 to 20 mg/kg IV. No fatal events or related serious adverse events werereported. No clinically significant dose-related trends in laboratory values,vital signs, electrocardiograms, or echocardiograms were noted. Galidesivir wassafe and generally well tolerated.

PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05160-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging and re-emerging vector-borne diseases (VBDs) pose arecurring threat to tropical countries, mainly due to the abundance anddistribution of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is a vector of the Zika,dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever arboviruses. METHODS: Female 3-5 day-oldAe. aegypti were distributed into two experimental groups: group I-survey ofcultivable bacteria; sucrose group: fed only on sucrose, i.e., non-blood-fed(UF); blood-fed group: (i) fed with non-infected blood (BF); (ii) fed with blood infected with the Zika virus (BZIKV); (iii) pretreated withpenicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep), and fed with non-infected blood (TBF); (iv) pretreated with pen/strep and fed blood infected with ZIKV, i.e., gravid withdeveloped ovaries, (TGZIKV); group II-experimental co-infections: bacteria generaisolated from the group fed on sucrose, i.e., non-blood-fed (UF). RESULTS: Using the cultivable method and the same mosquito colony and ZIKV strain described byin a previous work, our results reveled 11 isolates (Acinetobacter, Aeromonas,Cedecea, Cellulosimicrobium, Elizabethkingia, Enterobacter, Lysinibacillus,Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Staphylococcus). Enterobacter was present in all evaluated groups (i.e., UF, BF, BZIKV, TBF, and TGZIKV), whereasElizabethkingia was present in the UF, BZIKV, and TBF groups. Pseudomonas waspresent in the BZIKV and TBF groups, whereas Staphylococcus was present in theTBF and TGZIKV groups. The only genera of bacteria that were found to be present in only one group were Aeromonas, Lysinibacillus, and Serratia (UF); Cedacea,Pantoea and Acinetobacter (BF); and Cellulosimicrobium (BZIKV). The mosquitoesco-infected with ZIKV plus the isolates group fed on sucrose (UF) showedinterference in the outcome of infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that thedistinct feeding aspects assessed herein influence the composition of bacterialdiversity. In the co-infection, among ZIKV, Ae. aegypti and the bacterialisolates, the ZIKV/Lysinibacillus-Ae. aegypti had the lowest number of viralcopies in the head-SG, which means that it negatively affects vector competence. However, when the saliva was analyzed after forced feeding, no virus was detectedin the mosquito groups ZIKV/Lysinibacillus-Lu. longipalpis and Ae. aegypti; thecombination of ZIKV/Serratia may interfere in salivation. This indicates that thecombinations do not produce viable viruses and may have great potential as amethod of biological control.

TI  - Zika virus disrupts gene expression in human myoblasts and myotubes: Relationshipwith susceptibility to infection.
PG  - e0010166
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010166 [doi]
AB  - The tropism of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been described in the nervous system, blood,placenta, thymus, and skeletal muscle. We investigated the mechanisms of skeletalmuscle susceptibility to ZIKV using an in vitro model of human skeletal musclemyogenesis, in which myoblasts differentiate into myotubes. Myoblasts werepermissive to ZIKV infection, generating productive viral particles, whilemyotubes controlled ZIKV replication. To investigate the underlying mechanisms,we used gene expression profiling. First, we assessed gene changes in myotubescompared with myoblasts in the model without infection. As expected, we observed an increase in genes and pathways related to the contractile muscle system in themyotubes, a reduction in processes linked to proliferation, migration andcytokine production, among others, confirming the myogenic capacity of our systemin vitro. A comparison between non-infected and infected myoblasts revealed more than 500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In contrast, infected myotubesshowed almost 2,000 DEGs, among which we detected genes and pathways highly orexclusively expressed in myotubes, including those related to antiviral andinnate immune responses. Such gene modulation could explain our findings showing that ZIKV also invades myotubes but does not replicate in these differentiatedcells. In conclusion, we showed that ZIKV largely (but differentially) disruptsgene expression in human myoblasts and myotubes. Identifying genes involved inmyotube resistance can shed light on potential antiviral mechanisms against ZIKV infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify spatial patterns in cases of changes in growth anddevelopment related to Zika virus infection and other infectious etiologies(denominated Zika virus congenital syndrome in this study) reported in Maranhaofrom 2015 to 2018 and their relation with socioeconomic and demographicvariables. METHODS: Ecological study of notified Zika virus congenital syndromecases in the 217 cities of Maranhao, Brasil. Spatial autocorrelation wascalculated using GeoDa 1.14 software and the local and global (I) Moran's indexin univariate and bivariate analyses on Zika virus congenital syndrome incidence rate with Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), population density, Ginicoefficient and the cities' time of administrative political emancipation. Local Moran's Index was calculated to identify clusters with significant spatialautocorrelation. RESULTS: Spatial autocorrelation was checked in univariateanalysis of the incidence rate of Zika virus congenital syndrome (I=0,494;p=0,001) and positive correlation in bivariate analysis of the incidence ratewith Municipal Human Development Index (I=0,252; p=0,001), population density(I=0,338; p=0,001) and the cities' time of administrative political emancipation (I=0,134; p=0,001). The correlation between incidence rate with Gini coefficient was not significant (I= -0,033; p=0,131). Five high-incidence clusters were foundin distinct areas of the state. CONCLUSIONS: Cities with higher MHDI, higherpopulation density and more years of administrative political emancipation hadmore cases of Zika virus congenital syndrome notified.

LID - 10.1039/d1cc06737k [doi]
AB  - A new supramolecular approach to broad spectrum antivirals utilizes host guestchemistry between molecular tweezers and lysine/arginine as well as choline.Basic amino acids in amyloid-forming SEVI peptides (semen-derived enhancers ofviral infection) are included inside the tweezer cavity leading to disaggregationand neutralization of the fibrils, which lose their ability to enhanceHIV-1/HIV-2 infection. Lipid head groups contain the trimethylammonium cation of choline; this is likewise bound by molecular tweezers, which dock onto viralmembranes and thus greatly enhance their surface tension. Disruption of theenvelope in turn leads to total loss of infectiosity (ZIKA, Ebola, Influenza).This complexation event also seems to be the structural basis for an effectiveinihibition of cell-to-cell spread in Herpes viruses. The article describes thediscovery of novel molecular recognition motifs and the development of powerfulantiviral agents based on these host guest systems. It explains the generalunderlying mechanisms of antiviral action and points to future optimization andapplication as therapeutic agents.

LID - 10.1038/s41417-022-00436-7 [doi]
AB  - Self-replicating RNA viruses have been engineered as efficient expression vectorsfor vaccine development for infectious diseases and cancers. Moreover,self-replicating RNA viral vectors, particularly oncolytic viruses, have beenapplied for cancer therapy and immunotherapy. Among negative strand RNA viruses, measles viruses and rhabdoviruses have been frequently applied for vaccinedevelopment against viruses such as Chikungunya virus, Lassa virus, Ebola virus, influenza virus, HIV, Zika virus, and coronaviruses. Immunization of rodents and primates has elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses and providedprotection against lethal challenges with pathogenic viruses. Several clinicaltrials have been conducted. Ervebo, a vaccine based on a vesicular stomatitisvirus (VSV) vector has been approved for immunization of humans against Ebolavirus. Different types of cancers such as brain, breast, cervical, lung,leukemia/lymphoma, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma, have been thetargets for cancer vaccine development, cancer gene therapy, and cancerimmunotherapy. Administration of measles virus and VSV vectors have demonstrated immune responses, tumor regression, and tumor eradication in various animalmodels. A limited number of clinical trials have shown well-tolerated treatment, good safety profiles, and dose-dependent activity in cancer patients.

AB  - Flaviviruses include many significant human pathogens, comprising dengue, WestNile, Yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika and tick-borne encephalitisviruses and many others, affecting millions of people in the world. These viruseshave produced important epidemics in the past, they continue to do it and theywill undoubtedly continue to do so in the future. Flaviviruses enter into thecells via receptor-mediated endocytosis by fusing its membrane with the endosomalmembrane in a pH-dependent manner with the help of the envelope E protein, aprototypical class II membrane fusion protein. The envelope E protein has aconserved fusion peptide at its distal end, which is responsible in the firstinstance of inserting the protein into the host membrane. Since the participationof other segments of the E protein in the fusion process should not be ruled out,we have used atomistic molecular dynamics to study the binding of the distal end of domain II of the envelope E protein from Dengue virus (DENV) with a complexmembrane similar to the late-endosome one. Our work shows that not only thefusion peptide participates directly in the fusion, but also two other sequences of the protein, next to the fusion peptide it in the three-dimensional structure,are jointly wrapped in the fusion process. Overall, these three sequencesrepresent a new target that would make it possible to obtain effective antiviralsagainst DENV in particular and Flaviviruses in general.

LID - 10.1021/acsabm.1c01286 [doi]
AB  - The most important arboviruses are those that cause dengue, yellow fever,chikungunya, and Zika, for which the main vector is the Aedes aegypti mosquito.The use of repellents is an important way to combat mosquito-borne pathogens. In this work, a safe method of protection employing a repellent was developed based on a slow release system composed of zein nanoparticles containing the activeagents icaridin and geraniol incorporated in a cellulose gel matrix. Analyseswere performed to characterize the nanoparticles and the gel formulation. Thenanoparticles containing the repellents presented a hydrodynamic diameter of 229 +/- 9 nm, polydispersity index of 0.38 +/- 0.10, and zeta potential of +29.4 +/- 0.8 mV. The efficiencies of encapsulation in the zein nanoparticles exceeded 85% for icaridin and 98% for geraniol. Rheological characterization of the gelscontaining nanoparticles and repellents showed that the viscoelasticcharacteristic of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose gel was preserved. Release testsdemonstrated that the use of nanoparticles in combination with the gel matrix ledto improved performance of the formulations. Atomic force microscopy analysesenabled visualization of the gel network containing the nanoparticles.Cytotoxicity assays using 3T3 and HaCaT cell cultures showed low toxicityprofiles for the active agents and the nanoparticles. The results demonstratedthe potential of these repellent systems to provide prolonged protection whiledecreasing toxicity.

AB  - This in silico study aims to investigate flaviviruses as an environmental factor in the etiology of nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). A scoring method with 7 topics-disease, transplacental passage, tropism, cellular damage, reportedcase, analysis of genome similarity, and transcriptome between virus and host,was created based on literature and in silico experimentation. Viral genomes ofNCBI virus were obtained and BLAST 2.12.0 was applied for the similarityanalysis, adjusted to search for only human sequences related to CL/P with thestatistical threshold defined for E-value </=1. Flaviviruses with high potential to cause CL/P were: serotypes 2, 3, and 4 of the Dengue virus and lineage 2 ofthe West Nile virus, while the Yellow Fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus,Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Saint Louis encephalitis virus presented with medium potential to cause CL/P. As for the Zika virus, even strains associatedwith microcephaly showed only medium potential. Dengue virus and West Nile virus presented with high potential to act as environmental factors in the etiology of CL/P.

TI  - Apoptosis during ZIKA Virus Infection: Too Soon or Too Late?
LID - 1287 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23031287 [doi]
AB  - Cell death by apoptosis is a major cellular response in the control of tissuehomeostasis and as a defense mechanism in the case of cellular aggression such asan infection. Cell self-destruction is part of antiviral responses, aimed atlimiting the spread of a virus. Although it may contribute to the deleteriouseffects in infectious pathology, apoptosis remains a key mechanism for viralclearance and the resolution of infection. The control mechanisms of cell deathprocesses by viruses have been extensively studied. Apoptosis can be triggered bydifferent viral determinants through different pathways as a result of virallyinduced cell stresses and innate immune responses. Zika virus (ZIKV) induces Zikadisease in humans, which has caused severe neurological forms, birth defects, andmicrocephaly in newborns during the last epidemics. ZIKV also surprised byrevealing an ability to persist in the genital tract and in semen, thus beingsexually transmitted. Mechanisms of diverting antiviral responses such as theinterferon response, the role of cytopathic effects and apoptosis in the etiologyof the disease have been widely studied and debated. In this review, we examined the interplay between ZIKV infection of different cell types and apoptosis andhow the virus deals with this cellular response. We illustrate a duality in theeffects of ZIKV-controlled apoptosis, depending on whether it occurs too early ortoo late, respectively, in neuropathogenesis, or in long-term viral persistence. We further discuss a prospective role for apoptosis in ZIKV-related therapies,and the use of ZIKV as an oncolytic agent.

AB  - The innate immune system is the host's first line of defense against the invasionof pathogens including flavivirus. The programmed cell death controlled by genes plays an irreplaceable role in resisting pathogen invasion and preventingpathogen infection. However, the inflammatory cell death, which can trigger theoverflow of a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell contents, will initiate a severe inflammatory response. In this review, we summarized thecurrent understanding of the innate immune response, inflammatory cell deathpathway and cytokine secretion regulation during Dengue virus, West Nile virus,Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and other flavivirus infections. We also discussed the impact of these flavivirus and viral proteins on these biologicalprocesses. This not only provides a scientific basis for elucidating thepathogenesis of flavivirus, but also lays the foundation for the development ofeffective antiviral therapies.

AB  - In a world with an increasing population at risk of exposure to arthropod-borneflaviviruses, access to timely and accurate diagnostic tests would impactprofoundly on the management of cases. Twenty peptides previously identifiedusing a flavivirus proteome-wide microarray were evaluated to determine theirdiscriminatory potential to detect dengue virus (DENV) infection. This includednine peptides recognized by IgM antibodies (PM peptides) and 11 peptidesrecognized by IgG antibodies (PG peptides). A bead-based multiplex peptideimmunoassay (MPIA) using the Luminex technology was set-up to determine Abbinding levels to each of these peptides in a panel of 323 carefully selectedhuman serum samples. Sera are derived from individuals either infected withdifferent viruses, namely, the four DENV serotypes, Zika virus (ZIKV), yellowfever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), or receiving vaccination against YFV, tick-borneencephalitis (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Additionally, a setof healthy controls were included. We targeted a minimum specificity of 80% forall the analysis. The PG-9 peptide had the best sensitivity (73%) when testingDENV sera from acute patients (A-DENV; <8 days since symptom onset). With serafrom convalescent DENV patients (C-DENV; >10 days since symptom onset) the FPG-1 peptide was the best seromarker with a sensitivity of 86%. When combining allA-DENV and C-DENV samples, peptides PM-22 and FPG-1 had the best-diagnosticperformance with a sensitivity of 60 and 61.1%, and areas under the curve (AUC)of 0.7865 and 0.8131, respectively. A Random forest (RF) algorithm was used toselect the best combination of peptides to classify DENV infection at a targeted specificity >80%. The best RF model for PM peptides that included A-DENV andC-DENV samples, reached a sensitivity of 72.3%, while for PG peptides, the bestRF models for A-DENV only, C-DENV only and A-DENV + C-DENV reached a sensitivity of 88.9%, 89.1%, and 88.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the combination ofmultiple peptides constitutes a founding set of seromarkers for thediscrimination of DENV infected individuals from other flavivirus infections.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.813187 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has causeda pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is threatening globalhealth. SARS-CoV-2 spreads by air with a transmission rate of up to 15%, but the probability of its maternal-fetal transmission through the placenta is reportedto be low at around 3.28%. However, it is still unclear that which tissues anddevelopmental periods hold higher risks and what the underlying molecularmechanisms are. We conducted an integrated analysis of large-scale transcriptome and single-cell sequencing data to investigate the key factors that affectSARS-CoV-2 maternal-fetal transmission as well as the characteristics and effectsof them. Our results showed that the abundance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection-associated factors in the placenta were higher than their primarily infected tissues, while the expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 bindingreceptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) were similar between lung andplacenta. By contrast, an important SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated factor, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), was poorly expressed in placenta.Further scRNA-Seq analysis revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed invery few trophoblastic cells. Interestingly, during the embryonic developmentstages, the abundance of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was much higher in multiple embryonictissues than in the placenta. Based on our present analysis, the intestine in20th week of embryonic development was at a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Additionally, we found that during the fetal development, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 wereenriched in pathogen infection-associated pathways and may involve in thebiological processes related to T-cell activation. In conclusion, our presentstudy suggests that though the placenta provides a good physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 infection for healthy fetal development, multiple embryonic tissuesare under risks of the virus infection, which may be adversely affected onceinfected prenatally. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance maternal care toprevent the potential impact and harm of SARS-CoV-2 maternal-fetal transmission.

AB  - Mayaro Virus is an emerging arbovirus which can be responsible of importantoutbreaks in tropical regions. A retrospective study was performed in FrenchGuiana, an ultraperipheral region of Europe in Amazonia. We identified 17 humancases between 2003 and 2019. The clinical and biological picture was close toChikungunya with fever and arthralgia. One patient had acutemeningo-encephalitis, and 4 had persistent arthralgia. Physicians should be awareof this virus, as imported cases in Europe have already occurred. AUTHOR SUMMARY:Latin America has experienced several epidemics of arboviruses in recent years,some known for a long time, such as the dengue virus, and others of more recentintroduction such as the chikungunya or Zika viruses. There are other arbovirusesfor the moment more discreet which are rife with low noise in several countriesof the continent, such as the Mayaro virus. This alphavirus, with a presentation similar to that of the chikungunya virus, is currently confined to transmissionby forest mosquitoes, but its potential to be transmitted by coastal mosquitoessuch as Aedes aegypti, make it a potential candidate for a continent-wideepidemic. It therefore seems necessary to know this virus as well as possible in order to anticipate the occurrence of a possible new epidemic. We present here a both demographic and clinical study of this endemic arbovirus disease in FrenchGuiana.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks occurred in recent years on an unprecedented scale,which caused fever and severe complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome inadults and fetal abnormalities. No vaccines or other effective treatments againstZIKV are available to date. The CRISPR-Cas13 family has the unique ability totarget single-strand RNA molecules and mediate RNA cleavage. In the presentstudy, we sought to exploit CRISPR-Cas13b for developing an anti-ZIKV system inmammalian cells. We first generated a ZIKV infection and reporting system by: (1)fusing mCherry to the ZIKV capsid protein for reporting infection byfluorescence; and (2) deriving a 293T cell line (293T-DC-SIGN) stably expressing DC-SIGN (Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbingnon-integrin) that became highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. The CRISPR Cas13bexpression was reported to be in the cytoplasm of 293T-DC-SIGN cells using aCas13b-GFP fusion expression vector. Fourteen CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) were designed to target the most conserved regions of the ZIKV genome through bioinformaticsanalysis of 1138 ZIKV genome sequences. Five crRNAs were found to havesignificant effects (p < 0.001; two-sided t test) for Cas13b-targeted inhibition on ZIKV infection in 293T-DC-SIGN cells. Our study demonstrated an excitingexample of using the CRISPR-Cas13b system for the treatment and prevention ofZIKV infection, highlighting CRISPR-Cas13 as a promising therapeutic anti-RNAvirus strategy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediatedpolyneuropathy that primarily affects the peripheral nerves. Following the Zikavirus outbreak in Latin America, all the Latin American and Brazilian studiesconducted reported an increase in the incidence of GBS. The present study aims tocharacterize the clinical and demographic profile of patients with GBS, accordingto electrophysiological estudies. METHODS: This is a clinical cohort study based on data from medical charts and interviews conducted at the homes of GBS casesidentified by three data sources, admitted to and treated at a tertiary referral hospital between March 2017 and May 2019. RESULTS: There was a high level ofdiagnostic certainty among the 51 GBS cases monitored, with most classified asexhibiting acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). The majorityof the individuals were of working age, with an average schooling level. Diarrheaand upper respiratory tract infection were the previous events most reported.Most cases were admitted to the hospital unable to walk and the main complicationidentified was aspiration pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the needto rethink the care of patients with GBS in order to minimize the possibility of future complications during hospitalization that may lead to unfavorableoutcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have a severe impact onhuman health worldwide. To understand the dynamics of these viruses in mosquitopopulations, it is necessary to maintain surveillance during non-epidemic years. METHODS: We aimed to assess the presence of DENV and ZIKV in Aedes aegyptifemales in the state of Sergipe, northeastern Brazil, during a non-epidemic year.The Ae. aegypti females collected were sectioned, and the heads and thorax wereused to analyze the infection rate. Each female was first analyzed to detectFlavivirus using RT-PCR. Flavivirus-positive samples were further screened todetect ZIKV and DENV types 1, 2, 3 and 4. RESULTS: A total of 184 females werecollected. ZIKV was identified in 5.4% of the sample and DENV in 7.1%, with theDENV-positive samples belonging to subtypes 2, 3 and 4. The presence ofcoinfected vectors was also observed. Of the four cities tested, only one wasnegative for all viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the maintenance ofvigilance during non-epidemic years can provide data on viruses circulatingbefore the onset of outbreaks. This can enable the planning and implementation oflocal control measures to prevent the appearance of new outbreaks.

AB  - Cellular proteins often have multiple and diverse functions. This is illustrated with protein Spir-1 that is an actin nucleator, but, as shown here, alsofunctions to enhance innate immune signalling downstream of RNA sensing byRIG-I/MDA-5. In human and mouse cells lacking Spir-1, IRF3 andNF-kappaB-dependent gene activation is impaired, whereas Spir-1 overexpressionenhanced IRF3 activation. Furthermore, the infectious virus titres and sizes ofplaques formed by two viruses that are sensed by RIG-I, vaccinia virus (VACV) andZika virus, are increased in Spir-1 KO cells. These observations demonstrate the biological importance of Spir-1 in the response to virus infection. Like cellularproteins, viral proteins also have multiple and diverse functions. Here, we also show that VACV virulence factor K7 binds directly to Spir-1 and that adiphenylalanine motif of Spir-1 is needed for this interaction and forSpir-1-mediated enhancement of IRF3 activation. Thus, Spir-1 is a new virusrestriction factor and is targeted directly by an immunomodulatory viral protein that enhances virus virulence and diminishes the host antiviral responses.

AB  - Due to the concurrent prevalence and increasing risk of coinfection of theclinically important Arboviruses, timely and accurate differential diagnosis isimportant for clinical management and the epidemiological investigation. Atwo-tube multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous detection of Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunyavirus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus(WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was developed and optimized withhigh specificity and sensitivity. The detection limit for all the six virusescould reach as low as five genome equivalent copies and 2.8 x 10(-) (3) tissueculture infectious doses (TCID50 ) for ZIKV, YFV, CHIKV and 2.8 x 10(-2) TCID50for JEV per reaction, with high accuracy and precision (R(2) > 0.99). Thecoefficient of variation of intra-assay and inter-assay for our quantitativereverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was low, and the obtained positive rates ad Ct values of this assay were comparable withsingleplex commercial kits. Moreover, the multiplex qRT-PCR assay was able todetect possible co-infections without competitive inhibition of target viralgenomes. In conclusion, our rapid, sensitive, cost-effective multiplex qRT-PCRwill be of great use for differential diagnosis in a clinical setting andepidemiological investigation during surveillance.

TI  - Flaviviridae and mitochondria: Everything you always wanted to know about theirrelationship but were afraid to ask.
LID - 10.1684/vir.2022.0926 [doi]
AB  - Infections with Flaviviridae constitute a major public health concern, especiallyconsidering the limited availability of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. Most notably, the recent emergence of Zika virus in the Americas was associatedwith the dramatic increase of severe symptoms such as congenital microcephaly,while hepatitis C virus causes the death of approximately 300,000 individualsannually. Flaviviridae have evolved to hijack cellular organelles and to favortheir replication, often via divergent molecular mechanisms. In addition to theremodeling of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is required for the replication ofthe viral genome and the assembly of the neosynthesized virions, Flaviviridaeinduce drastic morphological alterations of the mitochondria. This is associated with the viral co-opting of several key mitochondrial functions in apoptosis,innate immunity and metabolism. This review recapitulates the current knowledgeabout the morphological and functional relationship between Flaviviridae andmitochondria and explains how this contributes to the establishment of acytoplasmic environment which is favorable to viral replication.

PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/s12864-022-08327-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti is a medically-important mosquito vector that transmitsarboviruses including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses tohumans. The mosquito exhibits typical sexually dimorphic behaviors such ascourtship, mating, host seeking, bloodfeeding, and oviposition. All thesebehaviors are mainly regulated by the brain; however, little is known about thefunction and neuron composition of the mosquito brain. In this study, wegenerated an initial atlas of the adult male and female brain of Ae. aegyptiusing 10xGenomics based single-nucleus RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 35 brain cell clusters in male and female brains, and 15 of those clusters wereassigned to known cell types. Identified cell types include glia (astrocytes),Kenyon cells, (ventral) projection neurons, monoaminergic neurons, medullaneurons, and proximal medulla neurons. In addition, the cell type compositions ofmale and female brains were compared to each other showing that they werequantitatively distinct, as 17 out of 35 cell clusters varied significantly intheir cell type proportions. Overall, the transcriptomes from each cell clusterlooked very similar between the male and female brain as only up to 25 genes weredifferentially expressed in these clusters. The sex determination factor Nix was highly expressed in neurons and glia of the male brain, whereas doublesex (dsx)was expressed in all neuron and glia cell clusters of the male and female brain. CONCLUSIONS: An initial cell atlas of the brain of the mosquito Ae. aegypti hasbeen generated showing that the cellular compositions of the male and femalebrains of this hematophagous insect differ significantly from each other.Although some of the rare brain cell types have not been detected in our singlebiological replicate, this study provides an important basis for the furtherdevelopment of a complete brain cell atlas as well as a better understanding ofthe neurobiology of the brains of male and female mosquitoes and their sexuallydimorphic behaviors.

PG  - 255-262
LID - 10.1097/INF.0000000000003379 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identify early predictors of poor neurodevelopment in infants withantenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. METHODS: Analysis of a prospective cohortof infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure confirmed by maternal or infant RT-PCR orIgM during the epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Clinical findings before 3months of age were associated with Bayley-III Scales of Infant and ToddlerDevelopment conducted after 6 months of age. RESULTS: ZIKV exposure was confirmedin 219 cases; 162 infants were normocephalic, 53 were microcephalic, 4 had nohead circumference recorded because of perinatal death/LTFU. Seven of the 112normocephalic infants developed secondary microcephaly between 3 weeks and 8months of age. Among the normocephalic at birth cohort, the mean HCZ amongnormal, at risk, and developmentally delayed children was significantly different(ANOVA, P = 0.02). In particular, the mean HCZ of the developmentally delayedgroup was significantly lower than that of the normal group (Tukey's test, P =0.014). HCZ was more strongly associated with lower expressive language scores (P= 0.04) than receptive language scores (P = 0.06). The rate of auditoryabnormalities differed among the normal, at risk, and developmentally delayedgroups (Chi-squared test, P = 0.016), which was driven by the significantdifference between the normal and at risk groups (post hoc test, P = 0.011, risk ratio 3.94). Auditory abnormalities were associated with both expressive andreceptive language delays (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:Clear predictors of neurodevelopment in normocephalic ZIKV-exposed children have not been previously identified. Our findings demonstrate that smaller HCZ andauditory abnormalities in these infants correlate with poor neurodevelopment astoddlers. Language delay is the most prominent developmental concern among these children, who will require frequent auditory and speech evaluations throughoutchildhood.

One ofthe compounds, 6-bromo-1,2-naphthalenedione, exhibited high specific inhibitionagainst ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, but had no inhibitory effects against other viralproteases. A microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay confirmed that the compoundbound to ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protein with a binding constant (Kd) of 12.26 muM.Indirect immunofluorescence assays, Western blots, and plaque assays indicatedthat the compound inhibited virus replication in cells. Virus titer was reducedby more than 75% when the compound was present at 1 muM. A time-of-addition assayshowed that inhibition occurred at the virus replication stage, but not at theadsorption or invasion stages. The half cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of the compound on HeLa, Vero, and BHK-21 cells were 445.44 muM, 123.87 muM, and 123.64 muM, respectively. In vivo tests using infected AG129 mice demonstrated thattreatment with the compound reduced mortality by up to 60%. Mice treated with thecompound showed a reduction in histopathological lesions in brain, testis, andovary. Viral RNA, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA levels decreased significantly in thesetissues. In summary, this study has identified a small compound with high andspecific inhibitory effects on ZIKV. The compound can be used as a therapeuticagent and is also an ideal starting point for drug optimization.

AB  - Across the Pacific, and including in the Solomon Islands, outbreaks ofarboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are increasing in frequency,scale and impact. Outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease have the potential tooverwhelm the health systems of small island nations. This study mapped theseroprevalence of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and Ross River viruses in 5 studysites in the Solomon Islands. Serum samples from 1,021 participants were analysedby ELISA. Overall, 56% of participants were flavivirus-seropositive for dengue(28%), Zika (1%) or both flaviviruses (27%); and 53% of participants werealphavirus-seropositive for chikungunya (3%), Ross River virus (31%) or bothalphaviruses (18%). Seroprevalence for both flaviviruses and alphaviruses varied by village and age of the participant. The most prevalent arboviruses in theSolomon Islands were dengue and Ross River virus. The high seroprevalence ofdengue suggests that herd immunity may be a driver of dengue outbreak dynamics inthe Solomon Islands. Despite being undetected prior to this survey, serologyresults suggest that Ross River virus transmission is endemic. There is a realneed to increase the diagnostic capacities for each of the arboviruses to supporteffective case management and to provide timely information to inform vectorcontrol efforts and other outbreak mitigation interventions.

TI  - FluoRNT: A robust, efficient assay for the detection of neutralising antibodiesagainst yellow fever virus 17D.
PG  - e0262149
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0262149 [doi]
AB  - There is an urgent need for better diagnostic and analytical methods for vaccine research and infection control in virology. This has been highlighted by recentlyemerging viral epidemics and pandemics (Zika, SARS-CoV-2), and recurring viraloutbreaks like the yellow fever outbreaks in Angola and the Democratic Republicof Congo (2016) and in Brazil (2016-2018). Current assays to determineneutralising activity against viral infections in sera are costly in time andequipment and suffer from high variability. Therefore, both basic infectionresearch and diagnostic population screenings would benefit from improved methodsto determine virus-neutralising activity in patient samples. Here we describe arobust, objective, and scalable Fluorescence Reduction Neutralisation Test(FluoRNT) for yellow fever virus, relying on flow cytometric detection of cellsinfected with a fluorescent Venus reporter containing variant of the yellow fevervaccine strain 17D (YF-17D-Venus). It accurately measures neutralising antibodytitres in human serum samples within as little as 24 h. Samples from 32 vaccineesimmunised with YF-17D were tested for neutralising activity by both aconventional focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT) and FluoRNT. Both typesof tests proved to be equally reliable for the detection of neutralisingactivity, however, FluoRNT is significantly more precise and reproducible with a greater dynamic range than conventional FRNT. The FluoRNT assay protocol issubstantially faster, easier to control, and cheaper in per-assay costs. FluoRNT additionally reduces handling time minimising exposure of personnel to patientsamples. FluoRNT thus brings a range of desirable features that can accelerateand standardise the measurement of neutralising anti-yellow fever virusantibodies. It could be used in applications ranging from vaccine testing tolarge cohort studies in systems virology and vaccinology. We also anticipate the potential to translate the methodology and analysis of FluoRNT to otherflaviviruses such as West Nile, Dengue and Zika or to RNA viruses more generally.

TI  - The tiger mosquito in Lebanon two decades after its introduction: A growinghealth concern.
PG  - e0010206
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010206 [doi]
AB  - The tiger mosquito was introduced to the Eastern region of the Mediterraneanbasin more than twenty years ago. In Lebanon, it was first observed in 2002 in a limited number of locations mainly from the coastal area of the country. In theabsence of national entomological control program, this invasive mosquito became an established species and is now considered in many localities, a source ofnuisance because of its human biting behavior. Several entomological surveys wereconducted to monitor the geographic spread and the seasonal dynamics of Aedesalbopictus by collecting adult stages and by monitoring oviposition activity.Moreover, its susceptibility to the common groups of insecticides was assessedusing WHO standard bioassays. Previous vector competence studies revealed thatlocal strains were able to transmit Chikungunya and Dengue viruses. Due to theincreased risk of Zika virus introduction in the country, we determined thecompetence of local populations to transmit this virus. Mapping results showedthat Ae. albopictus is mainly spread in the relatively humid western versant ofthe Mount Lebanon chain reaching 1000m altitude, while it is absent from arid andsemi-arid inland areas. Besides, this mosquito is active during 32 weeks fromspring till the end of autumn. Local strains of the tiger mosquito aresusceptible to pyrethroids and carbamates but resistant to organophosphates andorganochlorines. They showed ability to transmit Zika virus; however, only 9% of females were capable to excrete the virus in their saliva at day 28 postinfection. Current and previous observations highlight the need to establish asurveillance system in order to control this mosquito and monitor the potentialintroduction of related diseases.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to identify the pathogens causing or associated withcongenital microcephaly in Brazil in the last 20 years due to the lack ofofficial information by the Health Authorities and, as a consequence theuncertainty on the real infectious etiology of congenital microcephaly. A review protocol was prepared according to the PRISMA recommendation, using the PubMed,SciELO and LILACS databases to search for references presenting original data on microcephaly caused by or associated with congenital infectious in Brazil, using the descriptors "MICROCEPHALY AND INFECTION". The search ended on 30/Jun/2020.All selected titles were read in full and analyzed independently by the threereviewers. After searching the databases, 2,389 articles were selected for title review. Of these, 109 were excluded due to duplicates and 2,236 according to the criteria defined in the review. Only 44 met the eligibility criteria and weretherefore read in full. Data extraction was performed on 10 articles, allpublished after 2015. Seven studies were literature reviews or case series, only two were case-control, and one was a cross-sectional study. As the studiesfocused on the period of the ZIKV epidemic in Brazil, the cases of congenitalmicrocephaly between 2015 and 2017 were attributed to maternal infection by this virus when it was not possible to prove the presence of other etiological agents.Among the TORCH agents, a predominance of syphilis was observed. The analyzedstudies did not add consistent information about the infectious causes orassociation of microcephaly in Brazil outside the period of ZIKV epidemic,revealing the need for more studies on the subject.

TI  - Influence of abiotic factors on the oviposition of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti(Diptera: Culicidae) in Northern Parana, Brazil.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue in the Americas and is also atransmitter of urban yellow fever arboviruses, Zika, and Chikungunya, all ofwhich have substantial economic impacts on the affected countries. Throughmathematical models, the influence of climatic factors on the oviposition of Ae. aegypti was determined. The data were collected in the city of Apucarana, Parana State, using oviposition traps. Daily data were submitted to a negative binomial regression model (p < 0.05). The analyses were performed using the R statistical program to determine the climatic factors that most influenced oviposition. APoisson regression showed that the variables temperature, atmospheric pressure,humidity, and precipitation significantly increased the number of eggs. However, using the semi-normal probability graph with a simulation envelope, it wasdetermined that the Poisson regression model was not adequate to explain therelationships between the variables. Thus, a negative binomial regression modelwas used, which overcame the problem of overdispersion, and showed that onlytemperature affected the increase in the number of eggs, where an increase of 1degrees C was expected to result in a 54.03% increase in the number of Ae.aegypti eggs.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of several arboviruses that has spreadthroughout the United States over the last three decades. With the emergence ofZika virus in the Americas in 2015-2016 and an increased need to understand thecurrent distributions of Ae. albopictus in the US, we initiated surveillanceefforts to determine the abundance of invasive Aedes species in Iowa. Here, wedescribe surveillance efforts from 2016 to 2020 in which we detect stable andpersistent populations of Aedes albopictus in three Iowa counties. Based ontemporal patterns in abundance and genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNAhaplotypes between years, our data support that Ae. albopictus are overwintering and have likely become established in the state. The localization of Ae.albopictus predominantly in areas of urbanization, and noticeable absence inrural areas, suggests that these ecological factors may contribute tooverwintering success. Together, these data document the establishment of Ae.albopictus in Iowa and their expansion into the Upper Midwest, where freezingwinter temperatures were previously believed to limit their spread. Withimpending climate change, our study provides evidence for the further expansionof Ae. albopictus into temperate regions of the United States resulting inincreased risks for vector-borne disease transmission.

TI  - Untargeted metabolomics-based response analysis of temperature and insecticideexposure in Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 2066
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-05630-z [doi]
AB  - In this study, we utilized an untargeted NMR metabolomics approach to identifythe vector response in terms of metabolic profiling after temperature andinsecticide exposure in comparison with the control. Clearly, temperature andinsecticide exposure cause changes in the underlying metabolism, and the NMRmetabolomic profile enables a direct examination of the immediate response of thevector to cope up with these changes. The present study was designed in fourparts: A-Aedes aegypti were exposed to 40 degrees C for one-hour, DDT-4%,malathion-5%, and deltamethrin-0.05% separately and, part B-D; one-hour exposure at 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C temperatures followed by one-hour exposure toinsecticide. The resultant metabolite profiles were compared with the control. Inresponse to temperature and insecticide exposure, several metabolites and alteredpathways were identified. Citrate, maltose, lipids, Nicotinate, Choline, Pyruvateand beta-hydroxybutyrate were found as important components of major biologicalpathways such as tri-carboxylic acid cycle, branched amino acid degradation,glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid and carbohydratemetabolism, nucleotide PRPP pathway, and phospholipid metabolism. Furthermore,the results also suggest that the changes imposed by exposure to temperature and insecticides individually, are reversed with combined exposure, thus negating theimpact of each other and posing a threat to the control of Aedes-borne diseasessuch as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever.

TI  - The Fauna, Diversity, and Bionomics of Culicinae (Diptera: Culicidae) inHormozgan Province, Southern Iran.
PG  - 987-996
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac003 [doi]
AB  - Hormozgan Province is one of the important foci of malaria in Iran. In additionto malaria pathogens, mosquitoes also transmit the pathogens that causedirofilariasis and West Nile fever in the province. Also, the threat of emerging aedine-borne viruses that cause infections, such as Chikungunya, dengue, andZika, is noticeable. There is little information about the fauna and bionomics ofCulicinae in the province. The present investigation aimed to study the fauna,diversity, and bionomics of culicines. The study was conducted from September2016 to April 2017 in four counties of Bandar Abbas, Bandar Khamir, Bashagard,and Jask. In total, 3,236 larvae and 1,901 adults including 16 culicine specieswere collected. The larvae of Culiseta longiareolata (Macquart) (25.65%), Culexpipiens Linnaeus (16.62%), and Cx. quinquefasciatus Say (16.16%) were mostabundant and Cx. hortensis Ficalbi (0.09%) was least abundant. Among adults, Cx. laticinctus Edwards (33.19%), Cx. quinquefasciatus (31.09%), and Cx. pipiens(11.99%) were the most prevalent species and Cs. longiareolata (0.47%), Aedescaballus (Theobald) (0.90%), and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus Giles (0.90%) were theleast prevalent species. The pairwise similarities of fauna of the counties anddifferent collecting methods and diversity indices were investigated. Moreecological data, especially on host preference, seasonality, and larval habitatcharacteristics, are needed as a basic knowledge for any intervention measuresusing integrated vector management.

LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.151420 [doi]
LID - e151420 [pii]
AB  - Immune cells express an array of inhibitory checkpoint receptors that areupregulated upon activation and limit tissue damage associated with excessiveresponse to pathogens or allergens. Mouse leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor B4 (LILRB4), also known as glycoprotein 49B (gp49B), is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor constitutively expressed in myeloid cells and upregulated in B cells, T cells, and NK cells upon activation. Here, we report that expression of LILRB4,which binds Zika virus (ZIKV), was increased in microglia and myeloid cellsinfiltrating the brains of neonatal mice with ZIKV-associatedmeningoencephalitis. Importantly, while C57BL/6 mice developed transientneurological symptoms but survived infection, mice lacking LILRB4/gp49B (LILRB4KO) exhibited more severe signs of neurological disease and succumbed to disease.Their brains showed increased cellular infiltration but reduced control of viral burden. The reduced viral clearance was associated with altered NK cell function in the absence of LILRB4/gp49B. In naive animals, this manifested as reducedgranzyme B responses to stimulation, but in ZIKV-infected animals, NK cellsshowed phenotypic changes that suggested altered maturation, diminished glucoseconsumption, reduced IFN-gamma and granzyme B production, and impairedcytotoxicity. Together, our data reveal LILRB4/gp49B as an important regulator ofNK cell function during viral infections.

AB  - Viral infections have a great impact on human health. The urgent need to find acure against different viruses led us to investigations in a vast range of drugs.Azithromycin (AZT), classified as a macrolide, showed various effects ondifferent known viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV), Zika, Ebola, Enterovirus (EVs) and Rhinoviruses (RVs), and Influenza A previously; namely, these viruses, which caused global concerns, are consideredas targets for AZT different actions. Due to AZT background in the treatment ofknown viral infections mentioned above (which is described in this study), in theearly stages of COVID-19 (a new zoonotic disease caused by a novel coronaviruscalled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) development,AZT drew attention to itself due to its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects asa valuable candidate for COVID-19 treatment. AZT usage instructions for treating different viral infections have always been under observation, and COVID-19 is noexception. There are still debates about the use of AZT in COVID-19 treatment.However, eventually, novel researches convinced WHO to announce thediscontinuation of AZT use (alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine) intreating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research aims to study the structure of allof the viruses mentioned above and the molecular and clinical effects of AZTagainst the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that affectsmany regions of the world. Infection, in utero, causes microcephaly and laterdevelopmental and neurologic impairments. The impact of ZIKV infection onneurocognition in adults has not been well described. The objective of the study was to assess the neurocognitive impact of ZIKV infection in adult rhesusmacaques. METHODS: Neurocognitive assessments were performed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) via a touch screen andmodified Brinkman Board before and after subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation. Immuneactivation markers were measured in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by multiplex assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: All animals (N = 8) had detectableZIKV RNA in plasma at day 1 post-inoculation (PI) that peaked at day 2 PI (median5.9, IQR 5.6-6.2 log10 genome equivalents/mL). In all eight animals, ZIKV RNAbecame undetectable in plasma by day 14 PI, but persisted in lymphoid tissues.ZIKV RNA was not detected in the CSF supernatant at days 4, 8, 14 and 28 PI butwas detected in the brain of 2 animals at days 8 and 28 PI. Elevations in markersof immune activation in the blood and CSF were accompanied by a reduction inaccuracy and reaction speed on the CANTAB in the majority of animals.CONCLUSIONS: The co-occurrence of systemic and CSF immune perturbations andneurocognitive impairment establishes this model as useful for studying theimpact of neuroinflammation on neurobehavior in rhesus macaques, as it pertainsto ZIKV infection and potentially other pathogens.

TI  - Anti-DENV-NS1 monoclonal antibody for the differential histopathologicaldiagnosis of hemorrhagic fever caused by dengue.
PG  - 777-783
LID - 10.1007/s42770-022-00697-2 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease in humans in tropical andsubtropical regions, especially in urban areas, and can cause major epidemics.Although a self-limiting illness, it may sometimes have serious hemorrhagicmanifestations, and the outcome of dengue hemorrhagic fever has similar clinical manifestations as in other infections, which could result in death. Therefore,autopsy procedures are required under certain circumstances such as inhemorrhagic fevers, sometimes to confirm or to clarify the diagnosis that mayhave epidemiological consequences. Normally, the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the Pathology Center of Adolfo Lutz Institute receives autopsy samples fromdifferent hospitals in Sao Paulo State to confirm a previous diagnosis,especially hemorrhagic fever of infectious etiology. For this diagnosis, we have been using a mouse polyclonal antibody to dengue virus that often does notprovide a clear conclusion, because of background staining or no relevantimmunostaining, which hampers the histopathological analysis. Accordingly, in thepresent study, anti-DENV-NS1 monoclonal antibody (4H2) was tested to determineits accuracy in immunohistochemical analysis. Twenty-four autopsy cases ofhemorrhagic febrile syndrome showing histopathological alterations compatiblewith dengue disease were studied: twenty cases were confirmed by RT-PCR forDENV-2 and in four by RT-PCR for yellow fever virus. Samples from autopsied casesof deaths caused by other infectious diseases (two meningitis C and two severeacute respiratory syndrome caused by influenza A H1N1) were included as negative control cases. Positive immunostaining for DENV-NS1 was detected in 16/20 (80%)liver samples and 11/15 (73%) spleen samples from autopsied hemorrhagic denguepatients, whereas the polyclonal antibody detected DENV antigens in 12/20 (60%)liver and in 6/15 (40%) spleen samples from the same cases. Positive results werenot obtained with liver biopsy samples from yellow fever or Neisseriameningitides and Flu-A cases. 4H2 mAb recognizes the native protein of the fourDENV serotypes in infected cells and did not cross-react with native ZIKV- orCHKV-infected cells by immunohistochemical assay, so it is a useful tool fordifferential histopathological conclusion of acute febrile hemorrhagic deaths.

TI  - Characterization of an Allosteric Pocket in Zika Virus NS2B-NS3 Protease.
PG  - 945-957
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01326 [doi]
AB  - The NS2B-NS3 protease from Zika virus (ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro) cleaves the viralpolyprotein, being essential for its replication and a therapeutic target.Inhibitors that target the active site of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro have been developed,but they tend to have unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties due to their highly positive charge. Thus, the characterization of allosteric sites in this protease provides new strategies for inhibitor development. Here, we characterized a newallosteric pocket in ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro, analogous to the one previously described for the dengue virus protease. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate thepresence of cavities around the residue Ala125, sampling protein conformations inwhich they are connected to the active site. This link between the residue Ala125and the active site residues was reinforced by correlation network analysis. Toexperimentally verify the existence of this allosteric mechanism, we expressedand purified the Ala125Cys mutant of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro and demonstrated that this variant is inhibited by the thiol-containing chemical probes5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and aldrithiol, which do not affect theactivity of the wild-type protein. Inhibition of the mutant protein is reversedby the addition of strong reducing agents, supporting the involvement of Cys125in covalent bond formation and enzyme inhibition. Together, our results provideexperimental evidence for an allosteric pocket in ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro, in the regionaround Ala125, and computational insights on the structural connection betweenthis region and the enzyme active site.

TI  - Emerging quinoline- and quinolone-based antibiotics in the light of epidemics.
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.14025 [doi]
AB  - Pandemics are large-scale outbreaks of infectious disease that can greatlyincrease morbidity and mortality all the globe. Since past 1990 till twentiethcentury, these infectious diseases have been major threat all over the globeassociated with poor hygiene and sanitation. In light of these epidemics,researches have gained enormous rise in the developing the potential therapeutic treatment. Thus, revolutionized antibiotics have led to the near eradication ofsuch ailments. Around 50 million prescription of antibiotics written in US peryear according to center for disease control and prevention (CDC) report. Thereis a wide range of antibiotics available which differ in their usage and theirmechanism of action. Among these quinoline and quinolone class of antibiotics getattention as they show tremendous potential in fighting the epidemics. Quinoline and quinolone comprise of two rings along with substitutions at differentpositions which is synthetically obtained by structural modifications of quinine.Quinoline and quinolone antibiotics exhibit extensive activities approved by FDA in the treatment of the several ailments such as gastrointestinal infections,urinary tract infections, prostate inflammation, malaria, gonorrhea, skininfection, colorectal cancer, respiratory tract infections. These are activeagainst both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This basic core ofquinoline and quinolone is vital due to its capability of targeting the pathogen causing disease and beneficial in treating the infectious disease. They inhibitthe synthesis of nucleic acid of bacteria which results in the rupture ofbacterial chromosome due to the interruption of enzymes such as DNA gyrase andtopoisomerase IV. There are various quinoline and quinolone compounds that aresynthetically derived by applying different synthesis approaches which show awide range of pharmacological activities in several diseases. The most commonlyused are fluoro, chloro, and hydroxychloro derivatives of quinoline andquinolone. These compounds are helpful in the treatment of numerous epidemics as a chief and combination therapy. These quinoline and quinolone pharmacophorefascinate the interest of researchers as they inhibit the entry of virus in host cell and cease its replication by blocking the host receptor glycosylation andproteolytic processing. They act as immune modulator by inhibiting autophagy and reduction of both lysosomal activity and production of cytokine. Therefore,quinoline and quinolone derivatives attain significance in area of research andtreatment of various life-threatening epidemics such as SARS, Zika virus, Ebolavirus, dengue, and COVID-19 (currently). In this chapter, the research andadvancements of quinoline- and quinolone-based antibiotics in epidemic managementare briefly discussed.

AB  - Zika fever is an emerging mosquito-borne disease. While it often causes no oronly mild symptoms that are similar to dengue fever, Zika virus can spread from apregnant woman to her baby and cause severe birth defects. There is no specifictreatment or vaccine, but the disease can be mitigated by using several controlstrategies, generally focusing on the reduction in mosquitoes or mosquito bites. In this paper, we model Zika virus transmission and incorporate agame-theoretical approach to study a repeated population game of DEET usage toprevent insect bites. We show that the optimal use effectively leads to diseaseelimination. This result is robust and not significantly dependent on the cost ofthe insect repellents.

TI  - Why did the Wolbachia transinfection cross the road? drift, deterministicdynamics, and disease control.
PG  - 92-105
LID - 10.1002/evl3.270 [doi]
AB  - Maternally inherited Wolbachia transinfections are being introduced into natural mosquito populations to reduce the transmission of dengue, Zika, and otherarboviruses. Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility provides afrequency-dependent reproductive advantage to infected females that can spreadtransinfections within and among populations. However, because transinfectionsgenerally reduce host fitness, they tend to spread within populations only after their frequency exceeds a critical threshold. This produces bistability withstable equilibrium frequencies at both 0 and 1, analogous to the bistabilityproduced by underdominance between alleles or karyotypes and by populationdynamics under Allee effects. Here, we analyze how stochastic frequency variationproduced by finite population size can facilitate the local spread of variantswith bistable dynamics into areas where invasion is unexpected from deterministicmodels. Our exemplar is the establishment of wMel Wolbachia in the Aedes aegypti population of Pyramid Estates (PE), a small community in far north Queensland,Australia. In 2011, wMel was stably introduced into Gordonvale, separated from PEby barriers to A. aegypti dispersal. After nearly 6 years during which wMel wasobserved only at low frequencies in PE, corresponding to an apparent equilibrium between immigration and selection, wMel rose to fixation by 2018. Using analytic approximations and statistical analyses, we demonstrate that the observedfixation of wMel at PE is consistent with both stochastic transition past anunstable threshold frequency and deterministic transformation produced by steady immigration at a rate just above the threshold required for deterministicinvasion. The indeterminacy results from a delicate balance of parameters needed to produce the delayed transition observed. Our analyses suggest that onceWolbachia transinfections are established locally through systematicintroductions, stochastic "threshold crossing" is likely to only minimallyenhance spatial spread, providing a local ratchet that slightly-butsystematically-aids area-wide transformation of disease-vector populations inheterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - HSV-2 Infection Enhances Zika Virus Infection of Primary Genital Epithelial CellsIndependently of the Known Zika Virus Receptor AXL.
PG  - 825049
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.825049 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted to people by bite of an infected mosquito and bysexual contact. ZIKV infects primary genital epithelial cells, the same cellstargeted by herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 seroprevalence is high in areaswhere ZIKV is endemic, but it is unknown whether HSV-2 increases the risk forZIKV infection. Here, we found that pre-infecting female genital tract epithelialcells with HSV-2 leads to enhanced binding of ZIKV virions. This effect did notrequire active replication by HSV-2, implying that the effect results from theimmune response to HSV-2 exposure or to viral genes expressed early in the HSV-2 lifecycle. Treating cells with toll-like receptor-3 ligand poly-I:C also lead to enhanced binding by ZIKV, which was inhibited by the JAK-STAT pathway inhibitorruxolitinib. Blocking or knocking down the well-studied ZIKV receptor AXL did notprevent binding of ZIKV to epithelial cells, nor prevent enhanced binding in the presence of HSV-2 infection. Blocking the alpha5 integrin receptor did notprevent ZIKV binding to cells either. Overall, our results indicate that ZIKVbinding to genital epithelial cells is not mediated entirely by a canonicalreceptor, but likely occurs through redundant pathways that may involve lectinreceptors and glycosaminoglycans. Our studies may pave the way to newinterventions that interrupt the synergism between herpes and Zika viruses.

TI  - Aedes mosquitoes in the emerging threat of urban yellow fever transmission.
PG  - e2333
LID - 10.1002/rmv.2333 [doi]
AB  - This last decade has seen a resurgence of yellow fever (YF) in historical endemicregions and repeated attempts of YF introduction in YF-free countries such as theAsia-Pacific region and the Caribbean. Infected travellers are the main entryroutes in these regions where competent mosquito vectors proliferate inappropriate environmental conditions. With the discovery of the 17D vaccine, itwas thought that YF would be eradicated. Unfortunately, it was not the case and, contrary to dengue, chikungunya and Zika, factors that cotribute to YFtransmission remain under investigation. Today, all the signals are red and it isvery likely that YF will be the next pandemic in the YF-free regions wheremillions of people are immunologically naive. Unlike COVID-19, YF is associatedwith a high case-fatality rate and a high number of deaths are expected. Thisreview gives an overview of global YF situation, including the non-endemicAsia-Pacific region and the Caribbean where Aedes aegypti is abundantlydistributed, and also proposes different hypotheses on why YF outbreaks have not yet occurred despite high records of travellers importing YF into these regionsand what role Aedes mosquitoes play in the emergence of urban YF.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a dangerous human pathogen and no antiviral drugs have been approved to date. The chalcones are a group of small molecules that are found in a number of different plants, including Angelica keiskei Koidzumi, also known as ashitaba. To examine chalcone anti-ZIKV activity, three chalcones,4-hydroxyderricin (4HD), xanthoangelol (XA), and xanthoangelol-E (XA-E), werepurified from a methanol-ethyl acetate extract from A. keiskei. Molecular andensemble docking predicted that these chalcones would establish multipleinteractions with residues in the catalytic and allosteric sites of ZIKV NS2B-NS3protease, and in the allosteric site of the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase(RdRp). Machine learning models also predicted 4HD, XA and XA-E as potentialanti-ZIKV inhibitors. Enzymatic and kinetic assays confirmed chalcone inhibition of the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease allosteric site with IC50s from 18 to 50 microM.Activity assays also revealed that XA, but not 4HD or XA-E, inhibited theallosteric site of the RdRp, with an IC50 of 6.9 microM. Finally, we tested thesechalcones for their anti-viral activity in vitro with Vero cells. 4HD and XA-Edisplayed anti-ZIKV activity with EC50 values of 6.6 and 22.0 microM,respectively, while XA displayed relatively weak anti-ZIKV activity with wholecells. With their simple structures and relative ease of modification, thechalcones represent attractive candidates for hit-to-lead optimization in thesearch of new anti-ZIKV therapeutics.

AB  - Arboviruses are diseases of worldwide importance in the field of communicablediseases. In Brazil, the reemergence of dengue and the emergence of chikungunyaand Zika since 2014 have led to epidemic waves of great magnitude and rapidspread. However, their diffusion patterns vary and change over time. This studyanalyzes the spatial diffusion of the simultaneous circulation of threearboviruses transmitted by the same vector in a large urban space over twoepidemic waves in consecutive years. An ecological study of spatial and temporal aggregates on the occurrence of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, from 2014 to 2019,in Feira de Santana, Bahia State, was carried out using data of cases reported tothe national surveillance system. Four different methods were used to analyze thespatial diffusion: Kernel Estimation with sequential maps, cumulativenearest-neighbor ratios (NNI) over time, spatial correlograms and localautocorrelation changes (LISA) over time. From 2014-2019, there were 21,723confirmed cases of arboviruses. The highest incidences were among women (496.9,220.2, and 91.0 cases/100,000 women for dengue, chikungunya and Zikarespectively). By age group, the highest incidences were from ages 10-19 yearsold (609.3 dengue cases/100,000), from 60 and more (306.7 chikungunyacases/100,000), and from 0-9 years old (124.1 Zika cases/100,000 inhabitants).The temporal distribution demonstrated two epidemic waves of simultaneouscirculation in 2014 and 2015. Kernel maps indicate that arboviruses spread toneighboring areas near the first hotspots, suggesting an expansion diffusionpattern. The NNI, spatial correlograms and LISA changes results suggest expansionpatterns for the three arboviruses in all periods. The spatial diffusion pattern of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya in the 2014-2015 epidemics in Feira de Santanawas expansion. These findings are useful to guide prevention measures and reduce occurrence in other areas.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family that can causeneurological disorders and congenital malformations. The NS2B-NS3 viral serineprotease is an attractive target for the development of new antiviral agentsagainst ZIKV. We report here a SAR study on a series of substrate-like lineartripeptides that inhibit in a non-covalent manner the NS2B-NS3 protease.Optimization of the residues at positions P1, P2, P3 and of the N-terminal andC-terminal portions of the tripeptide allowed the identification of inhibitorswith sub-micromolar potency with phenylglycine as arginine-mimicking group andbenzylamide as C-terminal fragment. Further SAR exploration and application ofthese structural changes to a series of peptides having a 4-substitutedphenylglycine residue at the P1 position led to potent compounds showing doubledigit nanomolar inhibition of the Zika protease (IC50 = 30 nM) with highselectivity against trypsin-like proteases and the proteases of other flavivirus,such as Dengue 2 virus (DEN2V) and West Nile virus (WNV).

AB  - Mosquitoes readily lose water when exposed to any humidity less than that of nearsaturated air unless mitigated, leading to shifts in behavior, survival,distribution, and reproduction. In this study, we conducted a series ofphysiological experiments on two prominent species in the Culicinae subfamily:Culex pipiens, a vector of West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti, a vector of yellowfever and Zika to examine the effects of dehydration. We exposed C. pipiens andA. aegypti to non-dehydrating conditions (saturated air), dehydrating conditions (air at a 0.89 kPa saturation vapor pressure deficit), several recoveryconditions, as well as to bloodfeeding opportunities. We show that dehydratedmosquitoes increase bloodfeeding propensity, improve retention, and decreaseexcretion of a post-dehydration bloodmeal. In addition, mosquitoes that take abloodmeal prior to dehydration exposure show increased survival over non-bloodfedcounterparts. Dehydration-induced alterations in survival, reproduction, andbloodfeeding propensity of C. pipiens and A. aegypti resulted in marked changesto vectorial capacity. Ultimately, these results become increasingly important asdrought intensifies in association with climate change and mosquitoes become morelikely to experience arid periods.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for the diagnosis of Chikungunya virusinfection: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e0010152
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes febrile illnesses and has alwaysbeen misdiagnosed as other viral infections, such as dengue and Zika; thus, alaboratory test is needed. Serological tests are commonly used to diagnose CHIKV infection, but their accuracy is questionable due to varying degrees of reported sensitivities and specificities. Herein, we conducted a systematic review andmeta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests currently available for CHIKV. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL Complete, and Scopus databases from the 1st December 2020 until 22nd April 2021. Studies reporting sensitivity and specificity ofserological tests against CHIKV that used whole blood, serum, or plasma wereincluded. QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability,while R software was used for statistical analyses. Thirty-five studies wereincluded in this meta-analysis; 72 index test data were extracted and analysed.Rapid and ELISA-based antigen tests had a pooled sensitivity of 85.8% and 82.2%, respectively, and a pooled specificity of 96.1% and 96.0%, respectively.According to our meta-analysis, antigen detection tests serve as a gooddiagnostic test for acute-phase samples. The IgM detection tests had more than90% diagnostic accuracy for ELISA-based tests, immunofluorescence assays,in-house developed tests, and samples collected after seven days of symptomonset. Conversely, low sensitivity was found for the IgM rapid test (42.3%),commercial test (78.6%), and for samples collected less than seven of symptomonset (26.2%). Although IgM antibodies start to develop on day 2 of CHIKVinfection, our meta-analysis revealed that the IgM detection test is notrecommended for acute-phase samples. The diagnostic performance of the IgGdetection tests was more than 93% regardless of the test formats and whether the test was commercially available or developed in-house. The use of samplescollected after seven days of symptom onset for the IgG detection test suggeststhat IgG antibodies can be detected in the convalescent-phase samples.Additionally, we evaluated commercial IgM and IgG tests for CHIKV and found that ELISA-based and IFA commercial tests manufactured by Euroimmun (Lubeck, Germany),Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and Inbios (Seattle, WA) had diagnostic accuracy of above 90%, which was similar to the manufacturers' claim. CONCLUSION: Based on ourmeta-analysis, antigen or antibody-based serological tests can be used todiagnose CHIKV reliably, depending on the time of sample collection. The antigen detection tests serve as a good diagnostic test for samples collected during the acute phase (</=7 days post symptom onset) of CHIKV infection. Likewise, IgM and IgG detection tests can be used for samples collected in the convalescent phase(>7 days post symptom onset). In correlation to the clinical presentation of the patients, the combination of the IgM and IgG tests can differentiate recent andpast infections.

TI  - Current knowledge of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens in Zambia: A clarion call toscaling-up "One Health" research in the wake of emerging and re-emerginginfectious diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although vector-borne zoonotic diseases are a major public healththreat globally, they are usually neglected, especially amongresource-constrained countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa. Thisscoping review examined the current knowledge and identified research gaps ofvector-borne zoonotic pathogens in Zambia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Major scientificdatabases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, CABI, ScientificInformation Database (SID)) were searched for articles describing vector-borne(mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and tsetse flies) zoonotic pathogens in Zambia. Severalmosquito-borne arboviruses have been reported including Yellow fever, Ntaya,Mayaro, Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Chikungunya, Sindbis, and Rift Valley feverviruses. Flea-borne zoonotic pathogens reported include Yersinia pestis andRickettsia felis. Trypanosoma sp. was the only tsetse fly-borne pathogenidentified. Further, tick-borne zoonotic pathogens reported includedCrimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever virus, Rickettsia sp., Anaplasma sp., Ehrlichia sp., Borrelia sp., and Coxiella burnetii. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed thepresence of many vector-borne zoonotic pathogens circulating in vectors andanimals in Zambia. Though reports of human clinical cases were limited, severalserological studies provided considerable evidence of zoonotic transmission ofvector-borne pathogens in humans. However, the disease burden in humansattributable to vector-borne zoonotic infections could not be ascertained fromthe available reports and this precludes the formulation of national policiesthat could help in the control and mitigation of the impact of these diseases in Zambia. Therefore, there is an urgent need to scale-up "One Health" research inemerging and re-emerging infectious diseases to enable the country to prepare forfuture epidemics, including pandemics.

AB  - The Arboviral diseases are caused by arthropod-borne viruses, such as Mayarovirus (MAYV), the etiological agent of Mayaro fever. This disease has beendrawing the attention of the public health authorities for the increased numberof cases likely due to virus adaptation for survival to urban areas as well asinfection and multiplication in other vectors insects. Therefore, this work aimedto identify the MAYV infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Goiania, the capitalof state of Goias, Brazil. For the development of study, the larvae of A. aegyptiwere collected in Basic Health Units from different regions of Goiania then thelarvae were grown to adult mosquitoes in controlled laboratory conditions. Thefemale mosquitoes were submitted to the procedure of head and body separation.The RNAs obtained from these samples were analyzed by real-time PCR foridentification of arboviruses. We only detect the presence of MAVY in themosquitoes, in this sense our findings suggest that A. aegypti harbor MAYV indifferent anatomical sites, and potentially the process of vertical transmission of MAYV can occur in this vector.

TI  - Perturbation of Alphavirus and Flavivirus Infectivity by Components of theBacterial Cell Wall.
PG  - e0006022
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00060-22 [doi]
AB  - The impact of the host microbiota on arbovirus infections is currently not wellunderstood. Arboviruses are viruses transmitted through the bites of infectedarthropods, predominantly mosquitoes or ticks. The first site of arbovirusinoculation is the biting site in the host skin, which is colonized by a complex microbial community that could possibly influence arbovirus infection. Wedemonstrated that preincubation of arboviruses with certain components of thebacterial cell wall, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of some Gram-negativebacteria and lipoteichoic acids or peptidoglycan of certain Gram-positivebacteria, significantly reduced arbovirus infectivity in vitro. This inhibitoryeffect was observed for arboviruses of different virus families, includingchikungunya virus of the Alphavirus genus and Zika virus of the Flavivirus genus,showing that this is a broad phenomenon. A modest inhibitory effect was observed following incubation with a panel of heat-inactivated bacteria, includingbacteria residing on the skin. No viral inhibition was observed afterpreincubation of cells with LPS. Furthermore, a virucidal effect of LPS on viral particles was noticed by electron microscopy. Therefore, the main inhibitorymechanism seems to be due to a direct effect on the virus particles. Together,these results suggest that bacteria are able to decrease the infectivity ofalphaviruses and flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE During the past decades, the world has experienced a vast increase in epidemics of alphavirus and flavivirus infections.These viruses can cause severe diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis,and arthritis. Several alpha- and flaviviruses, such as chikungunya virus, Zikavirus, and dengue virus, are significant global health threats because of theirhigh disease burden, their widespread (re-)emergence, and the lack of (good)anti-arboviral strategies. Despite the clear health burden, alphavirus andflavivirus infection and disease are not fully understood. A knowledge gap in theinterplay between the host and the arbovirus is the potential interaction withhost skin bacteria. Therefore, we studied the effect of (skin) bacteria andbacterial cell wall components on alphavirus and flavivirus infectivity in cellculture. Our results show that certain bacterial cell wall components markedlyreduced viral infectivity by interacting directly with the virus particle.

LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01655-21 [doi]
AB  - Although lessons have been learned from previous severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, the rapid evolution of the viruses means that future outbreaks of a much larger scale arepossible, as shown by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses aswell as viruses in general. This study reports a comparative analysis of theamino acid usage within several key viral families and genera that are prone totriggering outbreaks, including coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus-HKU1[HCoV-HKU1], HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2),flavivirus (dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and Zika) and ebolavirus (Zaire, Sudan,and Bundibugyo ebolavirus). Our analysis reveals that the distribution of aminoacid usage in the viral genome is constrained to follow a linear order, and thedistribution remains closely related to the viral species within the family orgenus. This constraint can be adapted to predict viral mutations and futurevariants of concern. By studying previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we haveadapted this naturally occurring pattern to determine that although pangolinplays a role in the outbreak of COVID-19, it may not be the sole agent as anintermediate animal. In addition to this study, our findings contribute to theunderstanding of viral mutations for subsequent development of vaccines andtoward developing a model to determine the source of the outbreak. IMPORTANCEThis study reports a comparative analysis of amino acid usage within several key viral genera that are prone to triggering outbreaks. Interestingly, there isevidence that the amino acid usage within the viral genomes is not random but in a linear order.

TI  - Vector control strategies in Brazil: a qualitative investigation into communityknowledge, attitudes and perceptions following the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency ofInternational Concern following the rapid emergence of neonatal microcephaly inBrazil during the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic. In response, a nationalcampaign sought to control Aedes mosquito populations and reduce ZIKVtransmission. Achieving adherence to vector control or mosquito-bite reductionbehaviours, including the use of topical mosquito repellents, is challenging.Coproduction of research at the community level is needed to understand andmitigate social determinants of lower engagement with Aedes preventive measures, particularly within disempowered groups. DESIGN: In 2017, the Zika PreparednessLatin America Network (ZikaPLAN) conducted a qualitative study to understandindividual and community level experiences of ZIKV and other mosquito-bornedisease outbreaks. Presented here is a thematic analysis of 33 transcripts fromcommunity focus groups and semistructured interviews, applying the Health Belief Model (HBM) to elaborate knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of ZIKV and vector control strategies. PARTICIPANTS: 120 purposively sampled adults of approximatereproductive age (18-45); 103 women participated in focus groups and 17 men insemistructured interviews. SETTING: Two sociopolitically and epidemiologicallydistinct cities in Brazil: Jundiai (57 km north of Sao Paolo) and Salvador (Bahiastate capital). RESULTS: Four key and 12 major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) knowledge and cues to action; (2) attitudes and normative beliefs (perceived threat, barriers, benefits and self-efficacy); (3) behaviour change (householdprevention and community participation); and (4) community preferences for novel repellent tools, vector control strategies and ZIKV messaging. CONCLUSIONS:Common barriers to repellent adherence were accessibility, appearance andeffectiveness. A strong case is made for the transferability of the HBM to informepidemic preparedness for mosquito-borne disease outbreaks at the communitylevel. Nationally, a health campaign targeting men is recommended, in addition tolocal mobilisation of funding to strengthen surveillance, risk communication and community engagement.

AB  - As the Zika virus protease is an essential and well-established target for thedevelopment of antiviral agents, we biochemically screened for inhibitors using apurified recombinantly expressed form of this enzyme. As a result, we were ableto identify 10 new Zika virus protease inhibitors. These compounds are naturalproducts and showed strong inhibition in the biochemical assays. Inhibitoryconstants values for the compounds ranged from 5 nM to 8 muM. Among the mostpotent inhibitors are flavonoids like irigenol hexa-acetate (Ki =0.28 muM),katacine (Ki =0.26 muM), theaflavin gallate (Ki =0.40 muM) and hematein (Ki =0.33muM). Inhibitors from other groups of natural products include sennoside A (Ki=0.19 muM) and gossypol (Ki =0.70 muM). Several of the obtained compounds areknown for their beneficial health effects and have acceptable pharmacokineticcharacteristics. Thus, they could be of interest as lead compounds for thedevelopment of important and essential Zika antiviral drugs.

AB  - Dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever are arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito. In this regard, a number of techniques have emerged aiming tocombat its proliferation. Elimination of Aedes aegypti larvae by photodynamicaction has been reported as an efficient approach. In this regard, this study wasaimed at synthetize and characterize formulations with different proportions(w/w) of the plant-based photolarvicidal curcumin and d-mannitol (CCD 1-4) andtheir evaluation on sublethal photolarvicidal efficiency, photodegradationprofile,solubility, internalization, elimination time, persistence in simulatedfield, growth of microorganisms in water and the toxicity using an animal models (Zebrafish). CCD 3 (curcumin:d-mannitol 50:50 w/w) showed the best efficacy(LC50-24h = 0.01 mg/L), and also presented the shortest internalization andlongest elimination time, 60 min and 8 days, respectively. This formulationcaused an extrusion into the intestine and peritrophic membrane. Moreover, CCD 3 showed a photodegradation of 50% (in 24 h) under white fluorescent lamps. In asmall-scale field trial, CCD 3 had a residual time of 14 days and abnormalmicrobial growth was not observed. Finally, CCD 3 did not present any toxicity inZebrafish, after exposition for 24 h at 100 mg/L. Overall, these results raisethe possibility of reducing virus transmission through the controlledphotoinactivation of Aedes aegypti larvae using a non-toxic plant-basedformulated photolarvicide.

AB  - Glioma accounts for nearly 80% of all intracranial malignant tumors. It is amajor challenge to society as it is causes to impaired brain function in manypatients. Currently, gliomas are mainly treated with surgery, postoperativeradiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, the curative effects of these treatmentsare not satisfactory. Oncolytic virus (OV) is a novel treatment which works byactivating the immune functions and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. The OVpropagates indefinitely in the host cell, eventually leading to the death of hostcell. Subsequently, a large number of antigens and signal molecules are released which exert antitumor immunity. Several preclinical and clinical studies haveshown that G207, DNX2401, Zika and other viruses have important roles inmalignant tumors. For example, these viruses can reduce the growth of tumor cellswithout causing severe complications. However, the known OVs have not beenclearly classified. Herein, we divided OVs into neurotropic and non-neurophilicOVs based on whether the OVs are naturally neurotropic or not. The therapeuticeffects of each group were compared. Finally, challenges encountered in theclinical application of OVs in the treatment of malignant gliomas weresummarized.

TI  - Decomposition of socioeconomic inequalities in arboviral diseases in Brazil andColombia (2007-2017).
PG  - 717-726
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trac004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We used surveillance data from Brazil and Colombia during 2007-2017to assess the presence of socioeconomic inequalities on dengue, chikungunya andZika at the neighborhood level in two Latin American cities. METHODS: To quantifythe inequality, we estimated and decomposed the relative concentration index ofinequality (RCI) accounting for the spatiotemporal distribution of the diseases. RESULTS: There were 281 426 arboviral cases notified in Fortaleza, Brazil, and 40889 in Medellin, Colombia. The RCI indicated greater concentration of denguecases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIsfor chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during theirintroduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellinindicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI decomposition showed thatyear of notification and age were the main contributors to this inequality. InMedellin, the RCI decomposition showed that age and access to waste managementaccounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5% of the overall inequality towards the poorfor dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presentsestimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses and its decomposition intwo Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseasesin low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age,presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants ofthe heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomicspectrum.

TI  - Human Brain Organoids as an In Vitro Model System of Viral Infectious Diseases.
PG  - 792316
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.792316 [doi]
AB  - Brain organoids, or brainoids, have shown great promise in the study of centralnervous system (CNS) infection. Modeling Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in brainorganoids may help elucidate the relationship between ZIKV infection andmicrocephaly. Brain organoids have been used to study the pathogenesis ofSARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HSV-1, and other viral infectionsof the CNS. In this review, we summarize the advances in the development of viralinfection models in brain organoids and their potential application for exploringmechanisms of viral infections of the CNS and in new drug development. Theexisting limitations are further discussed and the prospects for the development and application of brain organs are prospected.

TI  - Efficacy of an inactivated Zika vaccine against virus infection during pregnancy in mice and marmosets.

LID - 10.1038/s41541-021-00426-0 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that can cause severe congenital birth defects. The utmost goal of ZIKV vaccines is to prevent both maternal-fetalinfection and congenital Zika syndrome. A Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV) was previously shown to be protective in non-pregnant mice and rhesus macaques.In this study, we further examined the efficacy of ZPIV against ZIKV infectionduring pregnancy in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice and common marmoset monkeys(Callithrix jacchus). We showed that, in C57BL/6 mice, ZPIV significantly reducedZIKV-induced fetal malformations. Protection of fetuses was positively correlatedwith virus-neutralizing antibody levels. In marmosets, the vaccine preventedvertical transmission of ZIKV and elicited neutralizing antibodies that remained above a previously determined threshold of protection for up to 18 months. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrate ZPIV's protective efficacy is both potentand durable and has the potential to prevent the harmful consequence of ZIKVinfection during pregnancy.

Monitoring andresponding to community awareness, concern, and possible knowledge gaps arecritical during public health emergencies. Here, we describe the review andanalysis of micro-blogs posted on Sina-Weibo, China's largest social mediaplatform, to develop and disseminate a Zika virus education campaign. METHODS: Weused CYYUN Voice Express' Weibo Spider tool and the search terms of "Zhaika" OR"Zika" OR "Zikv" to capture microblogs about Zika virus retrospectively fromFebruary 1 to December 31, 2016 and prospectively from June 1 to November 15,2017. We described microblogs meeting our inclusion criteria by month and Zikavirus outbreaks in Asia and by source (e.g., government agency, individual, orother). We identified common misleading or inaccurate content authored byindividual micro-bloggers (i.e., not supported by available scientific evidence) through a qualitative review. We used this information to develop and disseminatehealth awareness material about the Zika virus through China CDC's 12320 HealthHotline Weibo account. An online survey was conducted to obtain feedback on thematerial. RESULTS: We captured 15,888 microblogs meeting our inclusion criteria. Zika-related microblogs peaked in September 2016, corresponding to news reportsabout the Zika outbreak in Singapore (August to November 2016). Most microblogs(12,994 [82%]) were authored by individual users, followed by media agencies (842[5%]), businesses (829 [5%]), international organizations (370 [2%]), and Chinesegovernment agencies (235 [1%]). Relevant microblogs primarily focused on clinicalsymptoms and health risks, modes of transmission, and actions taken byindividuals to prevent infection and seek health care. Incorrect and/ormis-leading information from individual users concentrated on modes oftransmission and possible treatments. The microblog "#Zika is that far and thisclose" health campaign was posted on Sina-Weibo and Baidu (Internet search enginein China) on September 18, 2016. Younger respondents (p-value = 0.01), and those with at least a college education (p-value = 0.03), were more likely than otherrespondents to consider the online campaign reliable and trustworthy. CONCLUSION:Routine review of Sina-Weibo and other social media platforms could enhance theability of public health staff to effectively respond to community concerns andawareness during public health emergencies. Advancements of social mediamonitoring tools and staff training could help to promote health awareness duringemergencies by directly addressing public perceptions and concerns. Variousapproaches may be needed to reach different at-risk populations, particularlyolder and less educated populations who may prefer more traditional modes ofcommunication.

AB  - Aim: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health issue of increasingincidence. Coagulopathy after TBI is a frequent event, associated with a poorprognosis, and biomarkers that could predict coagulopathy occurrence are needed. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is useful as a cost-effective biomarker to assess prognosis and the need for cranial computed tomography in patients withmild TBI. As no study has yet evaluated the association of NLR with coagulopathy,we investigated whether the NLR at presentation could predict coagulopathyoccurrence after TBI. Materials & methods: A retrospective study was conducted ofpatients aged >18 years who attended the emergency department (ED) with TBI, overa 3-year period. We included all patients for whom the NLR at presentation wasavailable, and who underwent a brain CT scan. Results: The study included 173patients (mean age 57.4 +/- 21.1 years) with TBI, the most frequent cause ofwhich was a fall. According to the Glasgow Coma Scale, 37 patients had severeTBI, 19 moderate and 117 mild TBI and 40 patients (23.1%) developed coagulopathy.Their mean NLR was 7.5 +/- 6.7. Using receiver operating characteristic curveanalysis, a cut-off value of 4.2 for NLR had 87.5% sensitivity and 52.9%specificity for predicting coagulopathy occurrence. Conclusion: Coagulopathyoccurs frequently after TBI. This study investigated the value of NLR as abiomarker to predict coagulopathy occurrence, and concluded that NLR might be anovel and inexpensive biomarker for decision making in the management of TBI.Combination of NLR with other low-cost biomarkers and the clinical findings mightfurther increase accuracy in the prediction of coagulopathy.

OAB - Plain language summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health issue ofincreasing incidence. Coagulopathy after TBI is a frequent event, associated witha poor prognosis and biomarkers that could predict coagulopathy occurrence areneeded. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is useful as a cost-effectivebiomarker to assess prognosis and the need for cranial computed tomography inpatients with mild TBI. We found that NLR could additionally predict which TBIpatients might develop coagulopathy with a 87.5% sensitivity and 52.9%specificity. Combination of NLR with other low-cost biomarkers and the clinicalfindings might further increase accuracy in the prediction of coagulopathy.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Amplicon-based nanopore sequencing is increasingly used for molecularsurveillance during epidemics (e.g. ZIKA, EBOLA) or pandemics (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). However, there is still a lack of versatile and easy-to-use tools that allowusers with minimal bioinformatics skills to perform the main steps of downstream analysis, from quality testing to SNPs effect to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Here, we present ONTdeCIPHER, an amplicon-based Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing pipeline to analyze the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and otherpathogenes. Our pipeline integrates 13 bioinformatics tools. With a singlecommand line and a simple configuration file, users can pre-process their dataand obtain the sequencing statistics, reconstruct the consensus genome, identify variants and their effects for each viral isolate, infer lineage and, finallyperform multi-sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. AVAILABILITY:ONTdeCIPHER is available at https://github.com/emiracherif/ONTdeCIPHER.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.
