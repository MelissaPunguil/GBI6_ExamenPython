TI  - Host interactions of Aedes albopictus, an invasive vector of arboviruses, in 
      Virginia, USA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As an invasive mosquito species in the United States, Aedes 
      albopictus is a potential vector of arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, 
      and Zika, and may also be involved in occasional transmission of other 
      arboviruses such as West Nile, Saint Louis encephalitis, eastern equine 
      encephalitis, and La Crosse viruses. Aedes albopictus feeds on a wide variety of 
      vertebrate hosts, wild and domestic, as well as humans. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: In order to investigate blood feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus, 
      engorged specimens were collected from a variety of habitat types using the 
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps, Biogents Sentinel 2 
      traps, and modified Reiter gravid traps in southeast Virginia. Sources of blood 
      meals were determined by the analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene 
      sequences amplified in PCR assays. Our aims were to quantify degrees of Ae. 
      albopictus interactions with vertebrate hosts as sources of blood meals, 
      investigate arboviral infection status, assess the influence of key 
      socioecological conditions on spatial variability in blood feeding, and 
      investigate temporal differences in blood feeding by season. Analysis of 961 
      engorged specimens of Ae. albopictus sampled between 2017-2019 indicated that 
      96%, 4%, and less than 1% obtained blood meals from mammalian, reptilian, and 
      avian hosts, respectively. Domestic cats were the most frequently identified 
      (50.5%) hosts followed by Virginia opossums (17.1%), white-tailed deer (12.2%), 
      and humans (7.3%), together representing 87.1% of all identified blood hosts. We 
      found spatial patterns in blood feeding linked to socioecological conditions and 
      seasonal shifts in Ae. albopictus blood feeding with implications for 
      understanding human biting and disease risk. In Suffolk Virginia in areas of 
      lower human development, the likelihood of human blood feeding increased as 
      median household income increased and human blood feeding was more likely early 
      in the season (May-June) compared to later (July-October). Screening of the head 
      and thorax of engorged Ae. albopictus mosquitoes by cell culture and RT-PCR 
      resulted in a single isolate of Potosi virus. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Understanding mosquito-host interactions in nature is vital for evaluating 
      vectorial capacity of mosquitoes. These interactions with competent reservoir 
      hosts support transmission, maintenance, and amplification of zoonotic agents of 
      human diseases. Results of our study in conjunction with abundance in 
      urban/suburban settings, virus isolation from field-collected mosquitoes, and 
      vector competence of Ae. albopictus, highlight the potential involvement of this 
      species in the transmission of a number of arboviruses such as dengue, 
      chikungunya, and Zika to humans. Limited interaction with avian hosts suggests 
      that Ae. albopictus is unlikely to serve as a bridge vector of arboviruses such 
      as West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis in the study region, but that 
      possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.

      Populations in China.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is a vector of over 20 arboviruses that has spread throughout 
      the world, mainly in the second half of the twentieth century. Approximately 
      50-100 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by Aedes 
      mosquitoes each year, leading to heavy economic burdens for both governments and 
      individuals, among countless other negative consequences. Understanding the 
      vector competence of vector species is critical for effectively preventing and 
      controlling vector-borne diseases. Accordingly, in this study, vector competence 
      was evaluated by quantitative analysis of DENV-2 loads in mosquito tissues 
      (midguts, heads, and salivary glands) and whole mosquitoes through real-time 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Wolbachia and the 
      expression of immune-associated genes (Rel1, Rel2, Dicer2, and STAT) in 
      mosquitoes were also detected by RT-qPCR to explore their impact on vector 
      competence. The amount of DENV-2 in the mosquito midguts, heads, and salivary 
      glands from southern-western China were found to be lower than those from 
      eastern-central-northern China. The DENV-2 loads in whole mosquitoes showed a 
      negative correlation with Rel1 gene (r = -0.285, P = 0.011) and STAT gene 
      expression levels (r = -0.289, P = 0.009). In terms of Wolbachia strains, the 
      density of the wAlbB strain was found to be significantly higher than that of the 
      wAlbA strain in the eight Ae. albopictus populations, and the relative density of 
      the wAlbB strain in mosquitoes from southern-western China was higher than those 
      from eastern-central-northern China. The relative density of the wAlbB strain 
      showed a negative correlation with the mean loads of DENV-2 in the heads (r = 
      -0.729, P = 0.040), salivary glands (r = -0.785, P = 0.021), and whole mosquitoes 
      (r = -0.909, P = 0.002). Thus, there are lower DENV-2 loads in the mosquitoes 
      from southern-western China, which may be related to the innate immunity of 
      mosquitoes as affected by Rel1 in the Toll pathway, STAT in the JAK-STAT pathway, 
      and the relative density of the wAlbB strain.

AB  - The global population at risk from mosquito-borne diseases-including dengue, 
      yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika-is expanding in concert with changes in the 
      distribution of two key vectors: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The 
      distribution of these species is largely driven by both human movement and the 
      presence of suitable climate. Using statistical mapping techniques, we show that 
      human movement patterns explain the spread of both species in Europe and the 
      United States following their introduction. We find that the spread of Ae. 
      aegypti is characterized by long distance importations, while Ae. albopictus has 
      expanded more along the fringes of its distribution. We describe these processes 
      and predict the future distributions of both species in response to accelerating 
      urbanization, connectivity and climate change. Global surveillance and control 
      efforts that aim to mitigate the spread of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and 
      Zika viruses must consider the so far unabated spread of these mosquitos. Our 
      maps and predictions offer an opportunity to strategically target surveillance 
      and control programmes and thereby augment efforts to reduce arbovirus burden in 
      human populations globally.

AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894), is an invasive species 
      that can be found on all continents. The species, originally considered a 
      secondary vector of viruses such as Dengue viruses, has recently been suggested 
      to play a role in the transmission of Chikungunya virus in several countries 
      bordering the Indian Ocean, Central Africa and Europe. Here we review the current 
      geographic range and the relevant biological traits of A. albopictus in order to 
      explain its rapid spread. We examine and discuss recent changes in its role as a 
      vector, particularly in the transmission of arboviruses, and its importance in 
      the current and future emergence of pathogens. Finally, we report conventional 
      and innovative ways to control A. albopictus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is globally expanding and 
      has become the main vector for human arboviruses in Europe. With limited 
      antiviral drugs and vaccines available, vector control is the primary approach to 
      prevent mosquito-borne diseases. A reliable and accurate DNA sequence of the Ae. 
      albopictus genome is essential to develop new approaches that involve genetic 
      manipulation of mosquitoes. RESULTS: We use long-read sequencing methods and 
      modern scaffolding techniques (PacBio, 10X, and Hi-C) to produce AalbF2, a 
      dramatically improved assembly of the Ae. albopictus genome. AalbF2 reveals 
      widespread viral insertions, novel microRNAs and piRNA clusters, the 
      sex-determining locus, and new immunity genes, and enables genome-wide studies of 
      geographically diverse Ae. albopictus populations and analyses of the 
      developmental and stage-dependent network of expression data. Additionally, we 
      build the first physical map for this species with 75% of the assembled genome 
      anchored to the chromosomes. CONCLUSION: The AalbF2 genome assembly represents 
      the most up-to-date collective knowledge of the Ae. albopictus genome. These 
      resources represent a foundation to improve understanding of the adaptation 
      potential and the epidemiological relevance of this species and foster the 
      development of innovative control measures.

AB  - The mosquito Aedes albopictus is one of the most dangerous invasive species. Its 
      worldwide spread has created health concerns as it is a major vector of 
      arboviruses of public health significance such as chikungunya (CHIKV). Dynamics 
      of different genetic backgrounds and admixture events may have impacted 
      competence for CHIKV in adventive populations. Using microsatellites, we infer 
      the genetic structure of populations across the expansion areas that we then 
      associate with their competence for different CHIKV genotypes. Here we show that 
      the demographic history of Ae. albopictus populations is a consequence of rapid 
      complex patterns of historical lineage diversification and divergence that 
      influenced their competence for CHIKV. The history of adventive populations is 
      associated with CHIKV genotypes in a genotype-by-genotype interaction that 
      impacts their vector competence. Thus, knowledge of the demographic history and 
      vector competence of invasive mosquitoes is pivotal for assessing the risk of 
      arbovirus outbreaks in newly colonized areas.

TI  - [Aedes albopictus, vector of chikungunya and dengue viruses in Reunion Island: 
      biology and control].
PG  - 3-13
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-borne viruses 
      transmitted by the Aedes genus. Dengue is considered as the most important 
      arbovirus disease throughout the World. Chikungunya, known from epidemics in 
      continental Africa and Asia, has up to now been poorly studied. It has been 
      recently responsible for the severe 2004-2007 epidemic reported in the Indian 
      Ocean (IO), which has caused several serious health and economic problems. This 
      unprecedented epidemic of the IO has shown severe health troubles with morbidity 
      and death associated, which had never been observed before. The two major vectors 
      of those arboviruses in the IO area are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The 
      latest is considered as the main vector in most of the islands of the area, 
      especially in Reunion Island. Ae. albopictus showed strong ecological plasticity. 
      Small disposable containers were the principal urban breeding sites, and 
      preferred natural developmental sites were bamboo stumps and rock holes in 
      peri-urban and gully areas. The virus has been isolated from field collected Ae. 
      albopictus females, and in two out of 500 pools of larvae, demonstrating vertical 
      transmission. Experimental works showed that both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti 
      from west IO islands are efficient vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses. 
      Since 2006 and all along the epidemic of CHIKV, measures for the control of 
      larvae (temephos then Bacillus thuringiensis) and adults (fenitrothion, then 
      deltamethrine) of Ae. albopictus where applied along with individual and 
      collective actions (by the use of repellents, and removal of breeding sites 
      around houses) in Reunion Island. In order to prevent such epidemics, a 
      preventive plan for arboviruses upsurge is ongoing processed. This plan would 
      allow a quicker response to the threat and adapt it according to the virus and 
      its specific vector.

TI  - Population genetics of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, an invasive 
      vector of human diseases.

AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is currently one of the most 
      threatening invasive species in the world. Native to Southeast Asia, the species 
      has spread throughout the world in the past 30 years and is now present in every 
      continent but Antarctica. Because it was the main vector of recent Dengue and 
      Chikungunya outbreaks, and because of its competency for numerous other viruses 
      and pathogens such as the Zika virus, A. albopictus stands out as a model species 
      for invasive diseases vector studies. A synthesis of the current knowledge about 
      the genetic diversity of A. albopictus is needed, knowing the interplays between 
      the vector, the pathogens, the environment and their epidemiological 
      consequences. Such resources are also valuable for assessing the role of genetic 
      diversity in the invasive success. We review here the large but sometimes 
      dispersed literature about the population genetics of A. albopictus. We first 
      debate about the experimental design of these studies and present an up-to-date 
      assessment of the available molecular markers. We then summarize the main genetic 
      characteristics of natural populations and synthesize the available data 
      regarding the worldwide structuring of the vector. Finally, we pinpoint the gaps 
      that remain to be addressed and suggest possible research directions.

TI  - Mapping Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus Vector Mosquito 
      Distribution in Brownsville, TX.
PG  - 231-240
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjz132 [doi]
AB  - Aedes mosquitoes are vectors of several emerging diseases and are spreading 
      worldwide. We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of Aedes aegypti 
      (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) mosquito trap captures in Brownsville, 
      TX, using high-resolution land cover, socioeconomic, and meteorological data. We 
      modeled mosquito trap counts using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects model 
      with spatially correlated residuals. The models indicated an inverse relationship 
      between temperature and mosquito trap counts for both species, which may be due 
      to the hot and arid climate of southern Texas. The temporal trend in mosquito 
      populations indicated Ae. aegypti populations peaking in the late spring and Ae. 
      albopictus reaching a maximum in winter. Our results indicated that seasonal 
      weather variation, vegetation height, human population, and land cover determine 
      which of the two Aedes species will predominate.

TI  - Interactions of duck Tembusu virus with Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus 
      mosquitoes: Vector competence and viral mutation.
PG  - 106051

AB  - Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is an emerging flavivirus that causes severe disease 
      in avian hosts, while also affecting mammalian hosts; however, information on 
      viral interaction with mosquito vectors for mammalian hosts is limited. Vector 
      competence of Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for DTMUV were 
      investigated. Both Aedes mosquito species were orally infected with DK/TH/CU-1 
      strain of Thai DTMUV and isolated DTMUV from BALB/c mouse. Genomes of the viruses 
      isolated from hosts and vectors were analyzed and compared with the positive 
      virus. Findings showed that both Aedes mosquito species could serve as vectors 
      for DTMUV with minimum viral titer in blood meal of 10(6) TCID(50)/mL. After 
      taking blood meal with viral titer at 10(7) TCID(50)/mL, vector competence of the 
      mosquitoes was significantly different from the lower titer in both species. Both 
      Aedes species did not support development of the isolated viruses from mouse. A 
      point mutation of nucleotide and amino acid was found in all isolated DTMUV from 
      Ae. aegypti saliva, while other viruses were similar to the positive virus. Our 
      findings demonstrated that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus had potential to 
      transmit the virus and play important roles in the viral transmission cycle in 
      mammalian hosts, while viral mutation occurred in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.
